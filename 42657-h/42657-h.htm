<h2>GLEANINGS<br />
AMONG THE SHEAVES.</h2>


<h3 id="pg5">The Preciousness of the Promises.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> promises of God are to the
believer an inexhaustible mine
of wealth. Happy is it for him
if he knows how to search out
their secret veins, and enrich himself
with their hid treasures. They are an
armory, containing all manner of offensive
and defensive weapons. Blessed
is he who has learned to enter into the
sacred arsenal, to put on the breastplate
and the helmet, and to lay his hand to
the spear and to the sword. They are
a surgery, in which the believer will find
all manner of restoratives and blessed
elixirs; nor lacks there an ointment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
every wound, a cordial for every faintness,
a remedy for every disease. Blessed
is he who is well skilled in heavenly
pharmacy, and knoweth how to lay hold
on the healing virtues of the promises of
God. The promises are to the Christian
a storehouse of food. They are as the
granaries which Joseph built in Egypt,
or as the golden pot wherein the manna
was preserved. Blessed is he who can
take the five barley loaves and fishes of
promise, and break them till his five
thousand necessities shall all be supplied,
and he is able to gather up baskets
full of fragments. The promises are
the Christian's Magna Charta of liberty;
they are the title deeds of his heavenly
estate. Happy is he who knoweth how
to read them well, and call them all his
own. Yea, they are the jewel room in
which the Christian's crown treasures are
preserved. The regalia are his, secretly
to admire to-day, which he shall openly
wear in Paradise hereafter. He is already
privileged as a king with the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
key that unlocks the strong room; he
may even now grasp the sceptre, wear
the crown, and put upon his shoulders
the imperial mantle. O, how unutterably
rich are the promises of our faithful,
covenant-keeping God! If we had the
tongue of the mightiest of orators, and
if that tongue could be touched with a
live coal from off the altar, yet still it
could not utter a tenth of the praises of
the exceeding great and precious promises
of God. Nay, they who have entered
into rest, whose tongues are attuned to
the lofty and rapturous eloquence of
cherubim and seraphim, even they can
never tell the height and depth, the length
and breadth of the unsearchable riches
of Christ, which are stored up in the
treasure-house of God&mdash;the promises of
the covenant of His grace.</p>


<h3 id="pg7">Sorrow's Discipline.</h3>

<p>The Lord gets his best soldiers out of
the highlands of affliction.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3 id="pg8">The Christian Warfare.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is a tough battle which the
Christian is called to fight; not
one which carpet knights might
win; no easy skirmish which he
might gain, who dashed to battle on
some sunshiny day, looked at the host,
then turned his courser's rein, and
daintily dismounted at the door of his
silken tent. It is not a campaign which
he shall win, who, but a raw recruit to-day,
foolishly imagines that one week of
service will insure a crown of glory. It
is a life-long war; a contest which will
require all our strength, if we are to be
triumphant; a battle at which the stoutest
heart might quail; a fight from which
the bravest would shrink, did he not remember
that the Lord is on his side;
therefore whom shall he fear? God is
the strength of his life: of whom shall
he be afraid? This fight is not one of
main force, or physical might; if it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
we might the sooner win it; but it is all
the more dangerous from the fact that it
is a strife of mind, a contest of heart, a
struggle of the spirit&mdash;ofttimes an agony
of the soul.</p>

<p>Do you wonder that the Christian is
called to conflict? God never gives
strong faith without fiery trial; he will
not build a strong ship, without subjecting
it to very mighty storms; he will
not make you a mighty warrior, if he
does not intend to try your skill in battle.
The sword of the Lord must be used;
the blades of heaven must be smitten
against the armor of the evil one, and
yet they shall not break, for they are of
true Jerusalem metal, which shall never
snap. We shall conquer, if we begin
the battle in the right way. If we have
sharpened our swords on the cross, we
have nothing whatever to fear; for
though we may be sometimes cast down
and discomforted, we shall assuredly at
last put to flight all our adversaries, for
we are the sons of God even now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Why, then, should we fear? Who shall
bid us "stay," if God bid us advance?</p>

<h3 id="pg10">The Privileges of Trial.</h3>




<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is said, that when the stars
cannot be seen during the day
from the ordinary level of the
earth, if one should go down
into a dark well, they would be visible
at once. And certainly it is a fact,
that the best of God's promises are usually
seen by His Church when she is
in her darkest trials. As sure as ever
God puts His children in the furnace, He
will be in the furnace with them. I do
not read that Jacob saw the angel, until
he came into a position where he had to
wrestle, and then the wrestling Jacob
saw the wrestling angel. I do not know
that Joshua ever saw the angel of God,
till he was by Jericho; and then Joshua
saw the angelic warrior. I do not know
that Abraham ever saw the Lord, till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had become a stranger and a wanderer
in the plains of Mamre, and then the
Lord appeared unto him as a wayfaring
man. It is in our most desperate sorrows
that we have our happiest experiences.
You must go to Patmos to see
the revelation. It is only on the barren,
storm-girt rock, shut out from all the
world's light, that we can find a fitting
darkness, in which we can view the light
of heaven undistracted by the shadows
of earth.</p>

<h3 id="pg11">The Joy of Victory.</h3>




<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Christian's battle-field is
here, but the triumphal procession
is above. This is the land
of the sword and the spear: that
is the land of the wreath and the
crown. This is the land of the garment
rolled in blood and of the dust of the
fight: that is the land of the trumpet's
joyful sound, the place of the white
robe and of the shout of conquest. O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
what a thrill of joy shall be felt by all
the blessed, when their conquests shall
be complete in heaven; when death itself,
the last of foes, shall be slain; when
Satan shall be dragged captive at the
chariot wheels of Christ; when the great
shout of universal victory shall rise from
the hearts of all the redeemed! What a
moment of pleasure shall that be!</p>

<p>Something of the joy of victory we
know even here. Have you ever struggled
against an evil heart, and at last overcome
it? Have you ever wrestled hard
with a strong temptation, and known
what it was to sing with thankfulness,
"When I said my feet slipped, Thy
mercy, O Lord, held me up?" Have
you, like Bunyan's Christian, fought
with Apollyon, and after a fierce contest,
put him to flight? Then you have
had a foretaste of the heavenly triumph&mdash;just
an imagining of what the ultimate
victory will be. God gives you these
partial triumphs, that they may be earnests
of the future. Go on and conquer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and let each conquest, though a harder
one, and more strenuously contested, be
to you as a pledge of the victory of
heaven.</p>

<h3 id="pg13">Light in the Cloud.</h3>




<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Lord turned the captivity
of Job." So, then, our longest
sorrows have a close, and there
is a bottom to the profoundest
depths of our misery. Our winters
shall not frown forever: summer shall
soon smile. The tide shall not eternally
ebb out: the floods must retrace
their march. The night shall not hang
its darkness forever over our souls:
the sun shall yet arise with healing beneath
his wings. "The Lord turned the
captivity of Job." Thus, too, our sorrows
shall have an end when God has
gotten His end in them. The ends in the
case of Job were these, that Satan might
be defeated, foiled with his own weapons,
blasted in his hopes when he had every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>thing
his own way. God, at Satan's
challenge, had stretched forth his hand
and touched Job in his bone and in
his flesh; and yet the tempter could not
prevail against him, but received his rebuff
in those conquering words, "Though
he slay me, yet will I trust in Him."
When Satan is defeated, then shall the
battle cease. The Lord aimed also at
the trial of Job's faith. Many weights
were hung upon this palm-tree, but it
still grew uprightly. The fire had been
fierce, yet the gold was undiminished;
only the dross was consumed. Another
purpose the Lord had was His own glory.
And truly He was glorified abundantly.
God hath gotten unto His great name
and His wise counsels, eternal renown,
through that grace by which He supported
His poor afflicted servant under the
heaviest troubles which ever fell to the
lot of man. God had another end, and
that also was served. Job had been sanctified
by his afflictions. His spirit was
mellowed, and any self-justification which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lurked within was fairly driven out. And
now that God's gracious designs are answered,
He removes the rod; He takes
the melted silver from the midst of the
glowing coals. God doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the children of men for
nought, and He shows this by the fact
He never afflicts them longer than there
is a need for it. He never suffers them
to be one moment longer in the furnace
than is absolutely requisite to serve the
purposes of His wisdom and of His love.
"The Lord turned the captivity of Job."
Despair not, then, afflicted believer; he
that turned the captivity of Job can turn
thy captivity as the streams in the south.
He shall make thy vineyard again to
blossom, and thy field to yield her fruit.
Thou shalt again come forth with those
that make merry, and once more shall
the song of gladness be on thy lip. Let
not Despair rivet his cruel fetters about
thy soul. Hope yet, for there is hope
concerning this matter. Trust thou still,
for there is ground of confidence. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
shall bring thee up again, rejoicing, out
of captivity, and thou shalt yet sing to
his praise, "Thou hast turned for me
my mourning into dancing: thou hast
put off my sackcloth, and girded me
with gladness."</p>

<h3 id="pg16">Good Works.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> once the human heart is
put under the microscope of
Scripture, and we see it with a
spiritual eye, we perceive it to
be so vile, that we are quite sure it
would be just as impossible to expect
to find good works in an unrighteous,
unconverted man, as to hope to see fire
burning in the midst of the ocean. The
two things would be incongruous. Our
good works, if we have any, spring from
a real conversion; yet more, they spring
also from a constant spiritual influence
exercised upon us, from the time of conversion
even until the hour of death.
Ah, Christian, thou wouldst have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good works if thou hadst no fresh grace
day by day! Thou wouldst not find the
grace given thee at the first hour sufficient
to produce fruit to-day. It is not
like the planting of a tree in our hearts,
which naturally of itself bringeth forth
fruit; but the sap cometh up from the
root Jesus Christ. We are not trees by
ourselves, but we are branches fixed on
the Living Vine.</p>

<p>Our good works spring from union
with Christ. The more a man knows
and feels himself to be one with Jesus,
the more holy will he be. Why is a
Christian's character like Christ's character?
Only for this reason, that he is
joined and united to the Lord Jesus.
Why does the branch bring forth grapes?
Simply because it has been engrafted into
the vine, and therefore it partakes of the
nature of the stem. So, Christian, the
only way whereby thou canst bring forth
fruit to God is by being grafted into
Christ and united with him. If you think
you can walk in holiness without keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ing
up perpetual fellowship with Christ,
you have made a great mistake. If you
would be holy, you must live close to
Jesus. Good works spring only thence.
Hence we draw the most powerful reasons
against anything like trusting in
works; for as works are only the gift of
God, how utterly impossible it is for an
unconverted man to produce any such
good works in himself. And if they are
God's gifts, how little of our merit can
there be in them!</p>

<h3 id="pg18">The Knowledge of Christ's Love.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is the distinguishing mark of
God's people that they know the
love of Christ. Without exception,
all those who have passed
from death unto life, whatever they may
not know, have learned this. And without
exception, all those who are not saved,
whatever they may know besides, know
nothing of this. For to know the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of Christ, to taste its sweetness, to realize
it personally, experimentally, and vitally,
as shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost, is the privilege of the child of
God alone. This is the secure enclosure
into which the stranger cannot enter.
This is the garden of the Lord, so well
protected by walls and hedges that no
wild boar of the wood can enter. Only
the redeemed of the Lord shall walk
here. They, and only they, may pluck
the fruits, and content themselves with
the delights thereof.</p>

<p>How important, then, becomes the
question, Do I know the love of Christ?
Have I felt it? Do I understand it? Is
it shed abroad in my heart? Do I know
that Jesus loves me? Is my heart quickened,
and animated, and warmed, and
attracted towards Him through the great
truth that it recognizes and rejoices in,
that Christ has really loved me and
chosen me, and set His heart upon me?</p>

<p>But while it is true that every child
of God knows the love of Christ, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
equally true that all the children of God
do not know this love to the same extent.</p>

<p>There are in Christ's family, babes,
young men, strong men, and fathers.
And as they grow and progress in all
other matters, so they most certainly
make advances here. Indeed, an increase
of love, a more perfect apprehension
of Christ's love, is one of the best
and most infallible gauges whereby we
may test ourselves whether we have
grown in grace or not. If we have grown
in grace, it is absolutely certain that we
shall have advanced in our knowledge
and reciprocation of the love of Christ.
Many have believed in Jesus, and know
a little of His love; but, O! it is little
indeed they know, in comparison with
some others who have been brought into
the inner chamber, and made to drink of
the spiced wine of Christ's pomegranate.
Some have begun to climb the mountain,
and the view which lies at their feet is
lovely and passing fair, but the landscape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is not such as would greet their eyes
if they could but stand where advanced
saints are standing, and could look to the
east and to the west, to the north and to
the south, and see all the lengths, and
breadths, and depths, and heights of the
love of Christ which passeth knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="pg21">Clear Shining after Rain.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sway of Christ as King,
according to David's description,
is like "Clear shining after rain,"
whereby the tender grass is made
to spring out of the earth. So have we
often seen it. After a heavy shower of
rain, or after a continued rainy season,
when the sun shines, there is a delightful
clearness and freshness in the air that we
seldom perceive at other times. Perhaps
the brightest weather is just when the
rain has ceased, when the wind has
drifted away the clouds, and the sun
peers forth from his chambers to gladden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the earth with his smiles. And thus is
it with the Christian's exercised heart.
Sorrow does not last forever. After the
pelting rain of adversity cometh ever and
anon the clear shining. Tried believer,
consider this. After all thy afflictions
there remaineth a rest for the people of
God. There is a clear shining coming
to thy soul when all this rain is past.
When thy time of rebuke is over and
gone, it shall be to thee as the earth when
the tempest has sobbed itself to sleep,
when the clouds have rent themselves to
rags, and the sun peereth forth once more
as a bridegroom in his glorious array.
To this end, sorrow coöperates with the
bliss that follows it, like rain and sunshine,
to bring forth the tender blade.
The tribulation and the consolation work
together for our good. "As the sufferings
of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ." The
clear shining after rain produces an
atmosphere that refreshes herbs and
cereals: and the joy of the Lord, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seasons of sorrow, makes the soul fruitful.
Thus we grow in grace and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3 id="pg23">A Quiet Heart.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/u.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Unless</span> the heart be kept
peaceable, the life will not be
happy. If calm doth not reign
over that inner lake within the
soul, which feeds the rivers of our life,
the rivers themselves will always be in
storm. Our outward acts will always
tell that they were born in tempests, by
being tempestuous themselves. We all
desire to lead a joyous life; the bright
eye and the elastic foot are things which
we each of us desire; to carry about
a contented mind is that to which most
men are continually aspiring. Let us remember,

<h3 id="pg24">A Rich Life.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> one of our kings came
back from captivity, as old
chroniclers tell, there were fountains
in Cheapside which flowed
with wine. So bounteous was the king,
and so glad the people, that instead of
water, they made wine flow free to everybody.
There is a way of making our
life so rich, so full, so blessed to our fellow-men,
that the metaphor may be applicable
to us, and men may say, that
our life flows with wine when other
men's lives flow with water. Ye have
known some such men. John Howard's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
life was not like our poor, common lives:
he was so benevolent, his sympathy with
the race so self-denying, that the streams
of his life were like generous wine. You
have known personally, it may be, some
eminent saint, one who lived very near
to Jesus: when he talked, there was an
unction and a savor about his words,
a solidity and a strength about his utterances,
which you could appreciate,
though you could not attain unto it. You
have sometimes said, "I wish my words
were as full, as sweet, as mellow, and as
unctuous as the words of such a one.
O, I wish my actions were just as rich,
had as deep a color, and as pure a taste,
as the acts of some other to whom you
point. All I can do seems but little and
empty when compared with his high
attainments. O, that I could do more!
O, that I could send streams of pure gold
into every house, instead of my poor
dross!" Well, Christian, this should
stimulate thee to keep thine heart full
of rich things. Never, never neglect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the Word of God; that will make thy
heart rich with precept, thy head rich
with understanding, and thy bowels rich
with compassion; then, thy conversation,
when it flows through thy mouth, will
be from thy soul, and, like all that is
within thee, rich, unctuous, and savory.
Only let thy heart be full of sweet, generous
love, and the stream that flows
from thy lips will be sweet and generous.
Above all, get Jesus to live in thine heart,
and then out of thee shall flow rivers of
living water, more exhilarating, purer,
and more satiating than the water of the
well of Sychar, of which Jacob drank.
Go forth, with Christian, to the great mine
of unsearchable riches, and cry unto the
Holy Spirit to make thy heart rich unto
salvation. So shall thy life and conversation
be a boon to thy fellows; and when
they see thee, thy visage shall shine, and
thy face shall be as the angel of God.</p>

<h3 id="pg27">"He hath Said."</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> apostles, like their Master,
were always very ready at quotations.
As inspired men they
could have always used fresh
words, yet they preferred (and herein
they are an example to us) to quote old
words upon which the seal of divine
authority has been set aforetime&mdash;"He
hath said." Let us do the same, for,
though the words of ministers may be
sweet, the words of God are sweeter;
and though original thoughts may have
the charm of novelty, yet the ancient
words of God have the ring, and the
weight, and the value of old and precious
coins, and they will never be found wanting
in the day when we require to use
them. "He hath said," not only chases
away doubts and fears, but it also yields
nourishment to all our graces. When
the apostle would make us contented, he
says, "Be content with such things as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
ye have: for <i>He hath said</i>;" and when
he would make us bold and courageous,
he puts it thus forcibly, "<i>He</i> hath said,
I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
So that <i>we</i> may boldly say, "The Lord is
my helper, and I will not fear what man
shall do unto me." When the apostle
Paul would nourish faith, he does it by
feeding us from Scripture with the examples
of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of
Moses, of Gideon, of Barak, and of Jephthah.
When another apostle would calm
us with a lesson of patience, he says,
"Ye have heard of the patience of Job;"
or if it be our prayerfulness that he wants
to stir up, he says, "Elias was a man
subject to like passions as we are, and
he prayed and prevailed." "<i>He hath
said</i>," is refreshing food for every grace,
and a decisive death-blow for every sin.
Here you have nourishment for that
which is good, and poison for that which
is evil. Search, then, the Scriptures, for
so shall you grow healthy, strong, and
vigorous in the divine life.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>But besides searching them by reading,
and treasuring them by memory, we
should test them by experience, and so
often as a promise is proven to be true,
we should make a mark against it, and
note that we also can say, as did one of
old, "This is my comfort in my affliction;
for Thy word hath quickened me."
"Wait on the Lord," said Isaiah, and
then he added, "Wait, <i>I say</i>, on the
Lord," as if his own experience led him
to echo the voice of God to his hearers.
Test the promise; take God's bank-note
to the counter, and mark if it be cashed.
Grasp the lever which he ordains to lift
your trials, and try if it possesses real
power. Cast this divine tree into the
bitter waters of your Marah, and learn
how it will sweeten them. Take this
salt, and throw it into the turbid waters,
and witness if they be not made sweet,
as were the waters of old by the prophet
Elisha. "Taste and see that the Lord
is good ... for there is no want to
them that fear Him."</p>

<h3 id="pg30">Safety in Conflict.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> way that God keeps His
people in security is not by shutting
out their enemies from attacking
them, but by sustaining
them while engaged in the conflict. It
is not much to preserve ones' self behind a
wall which cannot be scaled, but to stand
where arrows are flying thick as hail,
where lances are being pushed with fury,
where the sword-cuts are falling on every
part, and in the midst of all to prove invulnerable,
invincible, immortal, this is
to wear a divine life which cannot be
conquered by human power. Such is the
calling of the Christian. God will put
us where we must be tried and tempted.
If we are not tried, there is no honor to
Him who preserves us; and if we are
not tempted, there is no gratitude to His
grace who delivers us out of temptations.
The Lord does not put his plants into
a hot-house, as some gardeners do; no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
He sets them out in the open air, and if
the frost is coming, He says, "Ah! but
no frost can kill them, and they will be
all the sturdier in the summer for the cold
in the winter." He does not shelter them
either from the heat of the sun, or from
the chills of the night. In this world
we must have tribulation, and we must
have much of it too, for it is through
much tribulation we inherit the kingdom.
What God does for His people is this:
He keeps them <i>in</i> tribulation, preserves
them in temptation, and brings them joyfully
out of all their trials. So, Christian,
you may rejoice in your security;
but you must not think that you are not
to be attacked; you are like a stream
from Lebanon, to be dashed down many
a cascade, to be broken over many a
rough rock, to be stopped up with many
a huge stone, to be impeded by many a
fallen tree; but you are to dash forward
with the irresistible force of God, sweeping
everything away, till you find at last
the place of your perfect rest.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">If</span> to-morrows are not to be
boasted of, are they good for
nothing? No, blessed be God.
There are a great many things
we may do with to-morrows. I will tell
you what we may do with them if we are
the children of God. We may always
look forward to them with <i>patience and
confidence</i>, that they will work together
for our good. We may say of the to-morrows,
"I do not boast of them, but I
am not frightened at them; I would not
glory in them, but I will not tremble
about them." Yes, we may be very easy
and very comfortable about to-morrow;
we may remember that all our times are
in His hands, that all events are at His
command; and though we know not all
the windings of the path of providence,
yet <i>He</i> knows them all; they are all
settled in His book, and our times are all
ordered by His wisdom. And, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
we may look upon the to-morrows as we
see them in the rough bullion of time,
about to be minted into every-day's expenditure,
and we may say of them all,
"They shall all be gold; they shall all
be stamped with the King's impress, and
therefore, let them come; they will not
make me worse&mdash;they will work together
for my good."</p>

<p>Yea, more, a Christian may rightly
look forward to his to-morrows, not simply
with resignation, but also with <i>joy</i>.
To-morrow to a Christian is a happy
thing; it is one stage nearer glory. It
is one step nearer heaven to a believer;
it is just one knot more sailed across the
dangerous sea of life, and he is so much
the nearer to his eternal port.</p>

<p>To-morrow! the Christian may rejoice
at it; he may say of to-day, "O day,
thou mayst be dark, but I shall bid thee
good by, for lo, I see the morrow coming,
and I shall mount upon its wings, and
shall flee away and leave thee and thy
sorrows far behind me."</p>

<h3 id="pg34">A Full Heart.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/y.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">You</span> have seen the great reservoirs
provided by our water
companies, in which water for
the supply of thousands of houses
is kept. Now, the heart is the reservoir
of man, from which the streams of his
life flow.</p>

<p>That life may flow through different
pipes&mdash;the mouth, the hand, the eye;
but still all the issues of hand, of eye, of
lip, derive their source from the great
fountain and central reservoir, the heart;
and hence there is no difficulty in showing
the great necessity that exists for
keeping this reservoir in a proper state
and condition, since otherwise that which
flows through the pipes must be tainted
and corrupt. Not only must the heart
be kept pure, but it must also be kept
<i>full</i>. However pure the water may be
in the central reservoir, it will not be
possible for us to have an abundant sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ply,
unless the reservoir itself be full.
An empty fountain will most assuredly
beget empty pipes; let the machinery be
never so accurate, let everything else be
well ordered, yet if that reservoir be dry,
we may wait in vain for water. See,
then, the necessity of keeping the heart
full; and let the necessity make you ask
this question: "But how can I keep my
heart full? How can my emotions be
strong? How can I keep my desires
burning and my zeal inflamed?" Christian!
there is one text which will explain
all this: "All my springs are in Thee,"
said David. If thou hast all thy springs
in God, thy heart will be full enough. If
thou goest to the foot of Calvary, there
will thy heart be bathed in love and gratitude.
If thou art often in the vale of
retirement, talking with thy God, thy
heart shall be full of calm resolve. If
you goest with thy Master to the hill of
Olivet, with Him to weep over Jerusalem,
then will thy heart be full of love for
never-dying souls. If thou art continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>ally
drawing thine impulse, thy life, the
whole of thy being from the Holy Spirit,
without whom thou canst do nothing,
and if thou art living in close communion
with Christ, there will be no fear of thy
having a dry heart. He who lives without
prayer&mdash;he who lives with little
prayer&mdash;he who seldom reads the Word&mdash;he
who seldom looks up to heaven for
a fresh influence from on high&mdash;he will
be the man whose heart will become dry
and barren; but he who calls in secret
on his God&mdash;who spends much time in
holy retirement&mdash;who delights to meditate
on the words of the Most High&mdash;whose
soul is given up to Christ&mdash;who
delights in His fulness, rejoices in his all-sufficiency,
prays for his second coming,
and delights in the thought of his glorious
advent&mdash;such a man must have an
overflowing heart; and as his heart is,
such will his life be. It will be a full
life; it will be a life that will speak from
the sepulchre, and wake the echoes of
the future. "Keep thine heart with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
diligence," and entreat the Holy Spirit to
keep it full; for otherwise, the issues of
thy life will be feeble, shallow, and superficial;
and thou mayest as well not have
lived at all.</p>

<p>O for a heart thus full, and deep, and
broad! Find the man that hath such a
heart, and he is the man from whom living
waters shall flow, to make the world
glad with their refreshing streams.</p>

<h3 id="pg37">Persevering Prayer.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/d.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Do</span> not give up those prayers
which God's Spirit has put in
your hearts&mdash;for remember, the
things you have asked for are
worth waiting for. Besides, you are a
beggar when you are in prayer; therefore
you must not be a chooser as to the time
when God shall hear you. If you had
right ideas of yourself, you would say,
"It is a wonder that He ever listens to
me at all, so unworthy as I am. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the Infinite indeed bow His ear to me?
May I hope He will at last listen to me?
Then I may well continue my prayers."</p>

<p>And recollect it is your only hope:
there is no other Saviour. This or none&mdash;Christ's
blood or else eternal wrath.
And to whom shall you go, if you turn
away from Him? None ever yet perished
pleading for mercy; therefore keep on.</p>

<p>Besides, better men than you have
had to wait. Kings, and patriarchs, and
prophets have waited; therefore surely
you can be content to sit in the King's
antechamber a little while. It is an
honor to sit as Mordecai did at the gate.
Pray on&mdash;wait on!</p>

<p>"Ah!" says one, "that is just what I
have been doing a long time." Yes, yes,
there are different kinds of waiting. A
man says, "I have been waiting:" but
he has folded his arms and gone to sleep.
You may <i>wait</i> in that way till you are
lost. The waiting I mean is "getting
all things ready"&mdash;the waiting of the
poor sufferer for the physician, who cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
out in pain, "Is the doctor coming?" I
will be surety for my Master when I say
that none such will be sent empty away.
He will never break his promise. <i>Try
Him</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">try Him</span>!</p>

<h3 id="pg39">Humility.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">What</span> is humility of mind? Humility
is to make a right estimate
of one's self. It is no humility
for a man to think less of himself
than he ought, though it might rather
puzzle him to do that. Some persons,
when they know they can do a thing, tell
you they cannot: but you surely would
not call that humility? A man is asked
to take part in some good work: "No,"
he says, "I have no ability;" yet, if
you were to say so of him, he would be
offended at you. It is not humility for a
man to stand up and depreciate himself,
and say he cannot do this, that, or the
other, when he knows that it is untrue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
If God gives a man a talent, do you think
the man does not know it? If a man has
ten talents, he has no right to be dishonest
to his Maker, and to say, "Lord,
thou hast only given me five." It is not
humility to underrate your endowments:
humility is to think of yourself, if you
can, as God thinks of you. It is to feel
that if we have talents, God has given
them to us, and let it be seen that, like
freight in a vessel, they tend to sink us
low. The more we have, the lower we
ought to lie. Humility is not to say,
"I have not this gift;" but it is to say, "I
have the gift, and I must use it for my
Master's glory. I must never seek any
honor for myself; for what have I that I
have not received?" Humility is to feel
that we have no power of ourselves, but
that it all cometh from God. Humility
is to lean on our Beloved, saying, "I
can do all things through Christ, who
strengtheneth me." It is, in fact, to annihilate
self, and to exalt the Lord Jesus
Christ as All in All.</p>

In all thy trials and afflictions,
look unto Christ, and find deliverance.
In all thine agony, in all thy

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Whatsoever</span> things are lovely,
and pure, and of good report,"
try and gain them; but remember
that all these things put
together, without faith, do not please
God. Virtues, <i>without faith</i>, are whitewashed
sins. Unbelief nullifies everything.
It is the fly in the ointment; it is
the poison in the pot. Without faith&mdash;with
all the virtues of purity, with all the
benevolence of philanthropy, with all the
kindness of disinterested sympathy, with
all the talents of genius, with all the
bravery of patriotism, and with all the
decision of principle&mdash;you have no title
to divine acceptance, for "without faith
it is impossible to please God."</p>

<p>Faith fosters every virtue; unbelief
withers every virtue in the bud. Thousands
of prayers have been stopped by
unbelief; many songs of praise, that would
have swelled the chorus of the skies, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
been stifled by unbelieving murmurs;
many a noble enterprise conceived in the
heart has been blighted ere it could come
forth by unbelief. Faith is the Samsonian
lock of the Christian: cut it off, and
he can do nothing. Peter, while he had
faith, walked on the waves of the sea.
But presently there came a billow behind
him, and he said, "That will sweep me
away;" and then another before, and he
cried out, "That will overwhelm me;"
and he thought, "How could I be so
presumptuous as to walk on the top of
these waves?" And as soon as he
doubted, he began to sink. Faith was
Peter's life-buoy&mdash;it kept him up; but
unbelief sent him down. The Christian's
life may be said to be always "walking
on the water," and every wave would
swallow him up; but faith enables him
to stand. The moment you cease to believe,
that moment distress and failure
follow. O, wherefore dost thou doubt,
then?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">In</span> calling the Lord Jesus "altogether
lovely," the Church
asserts that she sees nothing in
Him which she does not admire.
The world may rail at His cross and call
it shameful; to her it is the very centre
and soul of glory. A proud and scornful
nation might reject their King because
of His manger-cradle and peasant-garb,
but to her eye the Prince is glorious in
this poor apparel. He is never without
beauty to her; never is His visage
marred, or his glory stained. She presses
His pierced feet to her bosom, and looks
upon their wounds as jewels. Fools
stand by His cross and find full many a
theme for jest and scorn: she discovers
nothing but solemn reason for reverent
adoration and unbounded love. Viewing
Him in every office, position, and
relationship, she cannot discover a flaw;
in fact, the thought of imperfection is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
banished far away. She knows too well
His perfect Godhead and His spotless
manhood, to offer a moment's shelter to
the thought of a blemish in His immaculate
person; she abominates every teaching
that debases Him; she spurns the
most gorgeous drapery that would obscure
His beauteous features; yea, so
jealous is she of His honor, that she will
hear no spirit which doth not witness
to His praise. A hint against His undefiled
conception or His unsullied purity
would stir her soul to holy wrath, and
speedy would be her execration, and
relentless her execution of the heresy.
Nothing has ever aroused the ire of the
Church so fully as a word against her
Head. To all true believers this is high
treason, and an offence which cannot be
treated lightly. Jesus is without a single
blot or blemish, "altogether lovely."</p>

<p>Yet this negative praise, this bold denial
of fault, is far from representing the
fulness of the loving admiration of the
Church. Jesus is positively <i>lovely</i> in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
eyes. Not barely comely, nor merely
fair, His beauties are attracting beauties,
and His glories are such as charm the
heart. Love looks forth from those
"dove's eyes, washed with milk, and
fitly set;" it flows from those "lips like
lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh,"
and it sparkles on those hands which are
"full of gold rings, set with chrysolite."</p>

<p>But although this utterance of the
Church is the very climax of the language
of praise, and was doubtless intended as
the acme of all description, yet it is not
possible that this one sentence, even when
expanded by the most careful meditation,
should be able to express more than a
mere particle of the admiration felt. Like
a son of Anak, the sentence towers above
all others; but its stature fails to reach
the towering height of Heaven-born love.
It is but a faint symbol of unutterable
affection; a choice pearl washed on shore
from the deep sea of love.</p>

Speak, ye that have been led in the green

<h3 id="pg49">The Triumph of Grace.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is one of the greatest of
wonders that all men do not love
Christ. Nothing manifests more
clearly the utter corruption of our
race than the fact that "He was despised
and rejected of men." Those, however,
who have seen the fountains of the great
deep of human depravity broken up, are
not at a loss to account for the treatment
of the Messiah. It was not possible that
darkness should have fellowship with
light, or Christ with Belial. Fallen man
could not walk with Jesus, for the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
were not agreed. It was but the necessary
result of the contact of two such
opposites that the guilty creature should
hate the Perfect One. "Crucify Him,
crucify Him," is the natural cry of fallen
man. Our first wonder is displaced,
and another wonder fills the sphere of
thought. Did we marvel that all men
do not love?&mdash;it is a greater marvel still
that any man does love Jesus. In the
first case we saw the terrible blindness
which failed to discover the brightness
of the sun&mdash;with a shudder we saw it,
and were greatly amazed; but in this
second instance we behold Jesus of Nazareth
opening the fast-closed eye, and
scattering the Egyptian darkness with
the Divine radiance of His marvellous
light. Is this less a wonder? If it was a
strange thing to witness the fearful ravings
of the demoniac among the tombs,
it is surely far more a prodigy to see that
same man sitting at the feet of Jesus
clothed and in his right mind. It is indeed
a triumph of grace when man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
heart is brought to give its affection to
Jesus, for it proves that the work of
Satan is all undone, and that man is
restored from his fallen state.</p>

<h3 id="pg51">Religion a Personal Matter.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/s.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> men say that they will
test the holiness of Christ's religion
by the holiness of Christ's
people. You have no right, I
reply, to put the question to any such
test as that. The proper test that you
ought to use is to try it yourselves&mdash;to
"taste and see that the Lord is good."
By tasting and seeing you will prove His
goodness, and by the same process you
must prove the holiness of His Gospel.
Your business is to seek Christ crucified
for yourselves, not to take the representation
of another man concerning the
power of grace to subdue corruption and
to sanctify the heart. Inasmuch as God
has given you a Bible, He intended you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to read it, and not to be content with
reading <i>men</i>. You are not to be content
with feelings that rise through the conversation
of others; your only power to
know true religion is, by having His
Holy Spirit operating upon your own
heart, that you may yourself experience
what is the power of religion. You have
no right to judge religion from anything
extra or external from itself. And if you
despise it before you have tried it yourself,
you must stand confessed in this
world as a fool, and in the next world as
a criminal. And yet this is so with most
men. If you hear a man rail at the
Bible, you may usually conclude that he
never reads it. And you may be quite
certain if you hear a man speak against
religion, that he never knew what religion
was. True religion, when once
it takes possession of the heart, never
allows a man to quarrel with it. That
man will call Christ his best friend who
knows Christ at all. We have found
many who have despised the enjoyments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of this world, but we never found one
who turned from religion with disgust or
with satiety, after having once enjoyed
it. No! no! you chose your own delusions,
and you chose them at your own
risk; you foster them at your own peril.
For if you take your religion from other
people, and are led by the example of
professors to discard religion, you are
nevertheless guilty of your own blood.
God has not left you to the uncertain
chart of men's characters: He has given
you His own Word; the more sure
word of testimony, whereunto you do
well that ye take heed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I have known men run the
race of religion with all their
might, and yet they have lost it
because they did not start right.
You say, "Well, how is that?" Why,
there are some people who on a sudden
leap into religion. They get it quickly,
and they keep it for a time, and at last
they lose it because they did not get their
religion the right way. They have heard
that before a man can be saved, it is
necessary that, by the teaching of the
Holy Spirit, he should feel the weight
of sin, that he should make a confession
of it, that he should renounce all hope in
his own works, and should look to Jesus
Christ alone. They look upon all these
things as unpleasant preliminaries, and,
therefore, before they have attended to
repentance, before the Holy Spirit has
wrought a good work in them, before
they have been brought to give up every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>thing
and trust to Christ, they make a
profession of religion. This is just setting
up in business without a stock in trade,
and there must be a failure. If a man
has no capital to begin with, he may
make a fine show for a little time, but it
shall be as the crackling of thorns under
a pot,&mdash;a great deal of noise and much
light for a little while, but it shall die
out in darkness. How many there are
who never think it necessary that there
should be heart work within! Let us
remember, however, that there never was
a man who had a changed heart without
his first having a miserable heart.
We must pass through that black tunnel
of conviction before we can come out
upon the high embankment of holy joy;
we must first go through the Slough
of Despond before we can run along
the Walls of Salvation. There must be
ploughing before there is sowing; there
must be many a frost, and many a sharp
shower, before there is any reaping. But
we often act like little children who pluck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
flowers from the shrubs, and plant them
in their gardens without roots; then they
say how fair and how pretty their little
garden is; but wait a while, and all their
flowers are withered, because they have
no roots. This is all the effect of not
having a right start, not having the "root
of the matter." What is the good of
outward religion, the flower and the leaf
of it, unless we have the "root of the
matter" in us&mdash;unless we have been
ploughed with the plough of the Spirit,
and then have been sown with the sacred
seed of the Gospel, in the hope of bringing
forth an abundant harvest? There
must be a good start in running the Christian
race, for there is no hope of winning
unless the start be right.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Let</span> a man truly know the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and he will be a happy man;
and the deeper he drinks into
the Spirit of Christ, the happier will he
become. That religion which teaches
misery to be a duty is false upon the very
face of it, for God, when He made the
world, studied the happiness of His creatures.
You cannot help thinking, as you
see everything around you, that God has
sedulously, with the most strict attention,
sought ways of pleasing man. He has
not merely given us absolute necessaries,
He has given us more; not simply the
useful, but even the ornamental. The
flowers in the hedgerow, the stars in the
sky, the beauties of nature, the hill and
the valley&mdash;all these things were intended
not merely because we needed
them, but because God would show how
He loved us, and how anxious he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that we should be happy. Now, it is
not likely that the God who made a
happy world would send a miserable
salvation. He who is a happy Creator
will be a happy Redeemer; and those
who have tasted that the Lord is gracious,
can bear witness that the ways of
religion "are ways of pleasantness, and
all her paths are peace." And if this life
were all, if death were the burial of all
our life, and if the shroud were the winding-sheet
of eternity, still to be a Christian
would be a bright and happy thing,
for it lights up this valley of tears, and fills
the wells in the valley of Baca to the brim
with streams of love and joy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> way in which most men
get their faith increased is by
great trouble. We do not grow
strong in faith in sunshiny days.
It is in stormy weather that faith grows
stronger. Faith is not an attainment
that droppeth like the gentle dew from
heaven; it generally comes in the whirlwind
and the storm. Look at the old
oaks; how is it that they have become
so deeply-rooted in the earth? Ask the
March winds, and they will tell you. It
was not the April shower that did it, or
the sweet May sunshine, but the rough
wind shaking the tree to and fro, causing
its roots to strike deeper and to take a
firmer hold. And so must it be with us.
We cannot make great soldiers in the
barracks at home; they must be made
amidst flying shot and thundering cannon.
We cannot expect to make good
sailors on the Serpentine; they must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
trained far away on the deep sea, where
the wild winds howl, and the thunders
roll like drums in the march of the God
of armies. Storms and tempests are the
things that make men tough and hardy
mariners. They see the works of the
Lord, and His wonders in the deep. It is
thus with Christians. Great-faith must
have great trials. Mr. Great-heart would
never have been Mr. Great-heart if he
had not once been Mr. Great-trouble.
Valiant-for-truth would never have put
to flight those foes, and have been so
valiant, if the foes had not first attacked
him. We must expect great troubles
before we shall attain to much faith.</p>

He is there; His throne of grace is full

Speak, ye that know

the joys that earth calls good or great?
Say, if your immortal life could be extinguished,
would you give it up, even
for all the kingdoms of this world? O,
ye sons of poverty, has not this been a
candle to you in the darkness? Has not
this lightened you through the heavy
shades of your tribulation? O, ye sons
of toil, has not this been your rest, your
sweet repose? Have not the testimonies
of God been your song in the house of
your pilgrimage? O, ye children of sorrow,
racked with pain, has not religion
been to you a sweet <i>quietus</i> in your sufferings?
Is not religion worth having
in the sick chamber? And ye men of
business, speak for yourselves. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
have hard struggles to pass through life.
Sometimes you have been driven to a
great extremity, and whether you would
succeed or not seemed to hang upon a
thread. Has not your religion been a
joy to you in your difficulties? Has it
not calmed your minds? When you have
been fretted and troubled about worldly
things, have you not found it pleasant to
enter your closet, and shut to the door,
and tell your Father in secret all your
cares? And, O, ye that are rich, cannot
you bear the same testimony, if you have
loved the Master? What had all your
riches been to you without a Saviour?
Can you not say that your religion did
gild your gold, and make your silver
shine more brightly? For all things that
you have are sweetened by this thought,
that you have all these and Christ too.
Was there ever a child of God who could
deny this? We have heard of many
infidels who grieved over their infidelity
when they came to die: did you ever
hear of any one on his death-bed looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
back on a life of holiness with sorrow?
Never, never did we know a Christian
who repented of his Christianity. We
have seen Christians so suffering, that
we wondered that they lived; so poor,
that we wondered at their misery; we
have seen them so full of doubts, that we
pitied their unbelief; but we never heard
them say, even then, "I regret that I
gave myself to Christ." No; with the
dying clasp, when heart and flesh were
failing, we have seen them hug this treasure
to their breast, and press it to their
heart, still feeling that this was their life,
their joy, their all. O! if ye would be
happy, if ye would be saved, if ye would
strew your path with sunshine, and dig
out the nettles and blunt the thorns,
"Seek first the kingdom of God, and His
righteousness; and all these things shall
be added unto you." Seek not happiness
first; seek Christ first; and happiness
shall come after. Seek ye first the Lord,
and then He will provide for you in this
life, and He will crown it with everything
that is glorious in the life to come.</p>

and beautify, but He determines
that the old house shall be entirely swept
away, and that He will build a new one.
It is too far gone to be mended. If it
were only a little out of repair, it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be restored. If only a wheel or two of
that great thing called "Manhood" were
out of repair, then He who made man
might put the whole to rights; He might
put a new cog where it had been broken
off, and another wheel where it had gone
to ruin, and the machine might work
anew. But no; the whole of it is out of
repair; there is not one lever which is
not broken; not one axle which is not
disturbed. "The whole head is sick, and
the whole heart is faint. From the sole
of the foot to the crown of the head, it
is wounds, and bruises, and putrefying
sores." The Lord, therefore, does not
attempt the repairing of this thing, but
He says, "A new heart also will I give
you, and a new spirit will I put within
you."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> angels know what the joys
of heaven are, and therefore they
rejoice over one sinner that repenteth.
We talk about pearly
gates, and golden streets, and white robes,
and harps of gold, and crowns of amaranth;
but if an angel could speak to us
of heaven, he would smile and say, "All
these fine things are but child's talk, and
ye are little children, and ye cannot understand
the greatness of eternal bliss;
and therefore God has given you a child's
horn-book, and an alphabet, in which
you may learn the first rough letters of
what heaven is, but <i>what it is</i> thou dost
not know. O mortal, thine eye hath
never yet beheld its splendors; thine ear
hath never yet been ravished with its
melodies; thy heart has never been transported
with its peerless joys." Yes, we
may talk, and think, and guess, and
dream, but we can never measure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
infinite heaven which God has provided
for His children. But the angels know
its glory; hence a reason that they rejoice
over the repenting sinner who has thus
become heir to such an inheritance.</p>

how anxious He is concerning
them, not only for their
life, but for their comfort. Does
He say, "Strengthen ye, strengthen ye
my people?" Does He say to the angel,
"Protect my people?" Does He not say
to the heavens, "Drop down manna to
feed my people?" all that, and more also.
His tender regard secures to them. But
to show us that He is not only regardful
of our interests, but also of our superfluities,
He says, "Comfort ye, comfort
ye my people." He would have us not
only His living people, and His preserved
people, but He would have us His happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
people too. He likes His people to be
fed; but what is more, He likes to give
them "Wines on the lees well refined,"
to make glad their hearts. He will not
only give them "bread," but He will give
them "honey" too; He will not simply
give them "milk," but He will give them
"wine and milk." "Comfort ye, comfort
ye my people:" it is the Father's
yearning heart, careful even for the little
things of His people. "Comfort ye"
that one with a tearful eye; "Comfort
ye" yon child of mine with an aching
heart; "Comfort ye" that poor bemoaning
one; "Comfort ye, comfort ye my
people, saith your God."</p>

God's will is the believer's law.
He doth not ask what shall it

"Doth my Father command it?" And
his prayer is, "O Holy Spirit, help me to

want something to bear you up
in trouble? It is in the gospel:
"As thy days, so shall thy strength be."
Do you need something to nerve you for
duty? There is grace all-sufficient for
everything which God calls you to undergo
or to accomplish. Do you need
something to light up the eye of your
hope? O! there are joy-flashes in the
gospel which make your eye flash back
again the immortal fires of bliss. Do
you want something to make you stand
steadfast in the midst of temptation? In
the gospel there is that which can make
you immovable, always abounding in
the work of the Lord. There is no passion,
no affection, no thought, no wish,
no power which the gospel has not filled
to the very brim. The gospel was evidently
meant for manhood: it is adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

great mercies, but great faith still
greater. It was the custom in old times,
for all the poor in the parish to call at

and whatever size the bowl was, every
generous person would fill it. Faith is
our bowl: if we have got only "little
faith," we shall get that filled; but if we
have got "great faith," we shall have that
filled also. Little faith getteth much;
but great faith is a noble and princely
merchant, and doth a great trade&mdash;it

gaineth hundreds. Great faith getteth
hold of God's treasure.</p>

Go and say, "O Lord, illuminate it;

Blind men may read the Bible with their

<p class="drop-cap">A view of Christ is always
beneficial to a Christian&mdash;too
much of Christ we cannot have&mdash;there
can be no tautology

Christ always, Christ ever. The monotony

even the unity of Christ hath in it all

and in the tomb&mdash;Christ everywhere is
sweet to us. We love His name, we
adore His person, we delight to hear of
His works&mdash;the theme is ever new.</p>

<p>There are some who complain that
their love to the Saviour is faint and
cold. But this would not be if they were
more with Jesus. The closer you live to
Christ, and the more you know Him, the
better you will love Him. Do not try to
produce in yourself a certain degree of
love to Christ by some extraordinary

upon Him continually, picture to
yourself His sufferings for you, and then
you will love Him&mdash;it will become easy
to you, for <i>He</i> will draw your poor heart
closer to himself, as you thus think about
Him; and your love to Him will grow
just in proportion as you realize His love
to you.</p>

"Delight thyself in the Lord." When

be a delight. When it becomes

command to be glad, I must indeed
be foolish if I refuse my own joys, and

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Who</span> ever called the sea monotonous?
Even to the mariner,
travelling over it as he does,
sometimes by the year together,
there is always a freshness in the undulation
of the waves, the whiteness of the
foam of the breaker, the curl of the crested
billow, and the frolicsome pursuit of every
wave by its long train of brothers. Which
of us has ever complained that the sun
gave us but little variety? What though
at morn he yoke the same steeds, and
flash from his car the same golden glory,
climb with dull uniformity the summit of
the skies, then drive his chariot downward,
and bid his flaming coursers steep
their burning fetlocks in the western
deep? Or who among us would complain
loathingly of the bread which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
eat, that it palls upon the sense of taste?
We eat it to-day, to-morrow, the next
day; we have eaten it for years which
are passed; still the one unvarying food
is served upon the table, and bread remains
the staff of life. Translate these
earthly experiences into heavenly mysteries.
If Christ is your food and your
spiritual bread; if Christ is your sun,
your heavenly light; if Christ is the sea
of love in which your passions swim, and
all your joys are found, it is not possible
that you as Christian men, should complain
of monotony in Him. "He is the
same yesterday, to-day, and forever;"
and yet He has the "dew of His youth."
He is like the manna in the golden pot,
which was always the same; but he is
also like the manna which came down
from heaven, every morning new. He is
as the rod of Moses, which was dry, and
changed not its shape; but he is also to
us as the rod of Aaron, which buds, and
blossoms, and brings forth almonds.</p>

may they "glory in tribulations

certainty of the triumph of grace. I know
not whether all soldiers love the thought
of war&mdash;some do; there are many who
pant for a campaign. How often an
officer of low rank has repeated the murmur,
"There is no promotion; no hope
of rising; no honors; no prize-money,
as if we had to fight. Could we rush to
the cannon's mouth, there would be some
prospect before us of gaining promotion

our old campaigns. No, brethren, we
must have trials if we are to get on.
Young men do not become midshipmen

dry land; they must go out to sea. We
must do business in great waters; we

stood side by side with King David; we
must have gone down into the pit to

<p>Bethink thee, also, how utterly unworthy

Jehovah. Proud men must be noticed
at once, or they will depart; but thou
hast nothing to boast of, and shouldst feel
that if He disregarded thee for a long season,
thine unworthiness could demand
no apology for his delay. Moreover, remember

Christ in the heart, means Christ believed

There is no spiritual revelation

of holy delight we meet the challenge of
sentinel "If"&mdash;"If ye then be risen with

hill, even at Repentance-gate itself, He
meets us with a warrant of arrest, until
He sees whether our sorrow is the godly
sorrow which needeth not to be repented

<h3 id="pg95">Heaven an Inheritance.</h3>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>

<p class="drop-cap"><i><span class="upper-case">"The</span> inheritance of the saints</i>."
So then, heaven, with all its
glories, is an <i>inheritance</i>. Now,
an inheritance is not a thing
which is bought with money, earned by
labor, or won by conquest. If any man
hath an inheritance, in the proper sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of that term, it came to him by birth.
And thus it is with heaven. The man
who shall receive this glorious heritage,
will not obtain it by the works of the
law, nor by the efforts of the flesh; it
will be given to him as a matter of most
gracious right, because he has been "begotten
again unto a lively hope, by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead;" and has thus become an heir of
heaven by blood and birth. They who
come unto glory are sons; for is it not
written, "The Captain of our salvation
bringeth many sons unto glory?" They
come not there as servants; no servant
has any right to the inheritance of his
master. Be he never so faithful, yet is
he not his master's heir. But because ye
are sons&mdash;sons by the Spirit's regeneration&mdash;sons
by the Father's adoption&mdash;because
by supernatural energy ye have
been born again, ye become inheritors of
eternal life, and ye enter into the many
mansions of our Father's house above.
Let us always understand, then, when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
think of heaven, that it is a place which
is to be ours, and a state which we are to
enjoy as the result of <i>birth</i>&mdash;not as the
result of work. "Except a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God." That kingdom being an "inheritance,"
until ye have the new birth ye
can have no claim to enter it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"The</span> sleep of death"&mdash;what is
this sleep? We know that the
surface idea connected with sleep
is that of <i>resting</i>. The eyes of
the sleeper ache no more with the glare
of light or with the rush of tears; his
ears are teased no more with the noise
of strife or the murmur of suffering; his
hand is no more weakened by long protracted
effort and painful weariness; his
feet are no more blistered with journeyings
to and fro along a rugged road;
there is ease for aching heads, and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>taxed
nerves, and heavy hearts, in the
sweet repose of sleep. On yonder couch,
however hard, the laborer shakes off his
toil, the merchant his care, the thinker
his difficulties, and the sufferer his pains.
Sleep makes each night a Sabbath for the
day. Sleep shuts to the door of the soul,
and bids all intruders tarry for a while.
So is it with the body while it sleeps in
the tomb. The weary are at rest: the
servant is as much at ease as his lord.
No more the worker leans on his spade,
no more the thinker props his pensive
head. The wheel stands still; the shuttle
is not in motion; the hand which turned
the one and the fingers which threw the
other are quiet also. The grave shuts
out all disturbance, labor, or effort. The
toilworn believer quietly sleeps, as does
the child weary with its play, when
it shuts its eyes and slumbers on its
mother's breast. O! happy they who
die in the Lord; they rest from their
labors, and their works do follow them.
We would not shun toil, for though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
be in itself a curse, it is, when sanctified,
a blessing; yet toil for toil's sake we
would not choose: and when <i>God's</i> work
is done, we are too glad to think that
<i>our</i> work is done too. The mighty Husbandman,
when we have fulfilled our day,
shall bid His servants rest upon the best
of beds, for the clods of the valley shall
be sweet to them. Their repose shall
never be broken until He shall rouse
them up to give them their full reward.
Guarded by angel-watchers, curtained by
eternal mysteries, resting on the lap of
mother earth, ye shall sleep on, ye heritors
of glory, till the fulness of time shall
bring you the fulness of redemption.</p>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">Is</span> it possible for us to know
anything whatever of our heavenly
home? Is there power in
human intellect to fly into the
land of the hereafter, where God's people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
rest eternally? Our inquiry is met at
the outset by what seems a positive denial:
"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of
man, the things which God hath prepared
for them that love Him." If we
paused here, we might give up all idea of
beholding from hence that "goodly land
and Lebanon;" but we do not pause,
for, like the apostle, we go on with the
text, and we add, "But God hath revealed
them unto us by His Spirit." It <i>is</i> possible
to look within the veil; God's Spirit
<i>can</i> turn it aside for a moment, and bid
us take a glimpse, though it be a distant
one, at that unutterable glory. There
are "Pisgahs" even now on the earth,
from the top of which the celestial Canaan
can be beheld; there are hallowed hours
in which the mists and clouds are swept
away, and the sun shineth in his strength,
and our eye, being freed from its natural
dimness, beholds something of that land
which is very far off, and sees a little of
the joy and blessedness which is reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for the people of God hereafter. By the
Holy Spirit there is given to them, even
now, in seasons of blissful communion,
such experiences, joys, and feelings, as
seem to bring heaven down to them, and
make them able to realize, in some faint
measure, what heaven itself must be.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Let</span> us ever remember that
Christ on the cross is of no value
to us apart from the Holy Spirit
in us. In vain that blood is flowing,
unless the finger of the Spirit applies
the blood to our conscience; in vain is that
garment of righteousness wrought out,
unless the Holy Spirit wraps it around
us, and arrays us in its costly folds. The
river of the water of life cannot quench
our thirst, till the Spirit presents the goblet
and lifts it to our lips. All the things
which are in the paradise of God could
never be blissful to us, so long as we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
dead souls&mdash;and dead we are, until that
heavenly wind comes and breathes upon
us, that we may live. We do not hesitate
to say, that we owe as much to God
the Holy Ghost, as we do to God the
Son. Indeed, it were a high sin and
misdemeanor to attempt to put one person
of the divine Trinity before another.
Thou, O Father, art the source of all
grace, all love and mercy towards us.
Thou, O Son, art the channel of Thy
Father's mercy, and without Thee Thy
Father's love could never flow to us.
And Thou, O Spirit, art He who enables
us to receive that divine virtue which
flows from the fountain-head, the Father,
through Christ the channel, and which,
by Thy means, enters into our heart, and
there abides, and brings forth its glorious
fruit. Magnify, then, the Spirit. There
never yet was a heavenly thought, a
hallowed deed, or a consecrated act, acceptable
to God by Jesus Christ, which
was not worked in us by the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> believer enjoys, in favored

the Lord Jesus, as fills his heart
with an overflowing peace. O!
there are sweet words which Jesus whispers
in the ears of His people, and there
are love-visits which He pays to them,
which a man would not believe, even
though it should be told unto him. He
who would comprehend it, must experience
in his own heart what it is to
have fellowship with the Father, and with
His Son Jesus Christ. There is such a
thing as Christ manifesting Himself to
us as He does not unto the world. All
doubting thoughts are banished then, and
we can say, "I am my Beloved's, and
my Beloved is mine." This is the one
all-absorbing feeling. And what wonder
is it that the believer has such deep peace,
when Christ thus dwells in the heart, and
reigns there without a rival? It were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a miracle of miracles, if we did <i>not</i> have
peace. But how is it that our peace is
not more continuous? The only explanation
of our frequent loss of peace is, that
our communion is broken, and our fellowship
is marred; else would our peace be
like a river, and our righteousness like
the waves of the sea. Live near the

God's truths are the apples of gold, and

their parallel in the little world of man

every hope is nipped; when all the seeds
of joy lie buried beneath the dark clods
of despair; when our soul is fast fettered
like a river bound with ice, without
waves of joy, or flowings of thanksgiving.
Thanks be unto God, the soft south wind
breathes upon our soul, and at once the
waters of desire are set free, the spring of
love cometh on, flowers of hope appear
in our hearts, the trees of faith put forth
their young shoots, the time of the singing-birds
cometh in our hearts, and we
have joy and peace in believing through
the Lord Jesus Christ. That happy
springtide is followed in the believer by
a rich summer, when his graces, like
fragrant flowers, are in full bloom, loading
the air with perfume; and fruits of
the Spirit, like citrons and pomegranates,
swell into their full proportion in the
genial warmth of the Sun of Righteousness.
Then cometh the believer's autumn,
when his fruits grow ripe, and his
fields are ready for the harvest; the time
has come when his Lord shall gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
together his "pleasant fruits," and store
them in heaven; the feast of ingathering

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> are saved by faith, and not

as the root which is ever embedded
in the soil; feeling is casual, and has
its seasons&mdash;the bulb does not always
shoot up the green stem, far less is it
always crowned with its many flowers.
Faith is the tree, the essential tree: our
feelings are like the appearance of that
tree during the different seasons of the
year. Sometimes our soul is full of bloom
and blossom, and the bees hum pleasantly,
and gather honey within our hearts.
It is then that our feelings bear witness
to the life of our faith, just as the buds
of spring bear witness to the life of the
tree. Anon, our feelings gather still
greater vigor, and after we come to the
summer of our delights, again perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we begin to wither into the sear and
yellow leaf of autumn; nay, sometimes
the winter of our despondency and despair
will strip away every leaf from the
tree, and our poor faith stands like a
blasted stem without a sign of verdure.
And yet, so long as the tree of faith is
there, we are saved. Whether faith
blossom or not, whether it bring forth
joyous fruit in our experience or not, so
long as it be there in all its permanence,
we are saved. Yet should we have the
gravest reason to distrust the life of our
faith, if it did not sometimes blossom with
joy, and often bring forth fruit unto holiness.</p>

There is no beauty anywhere but in
Christ. O sun, thou art not fair, when
once compared with Him. O, fair world,
and grand creation of a glorious God,
thou art but a dim and dusky blot compared
with the splendors of His face.
When we shall see Christ, we shall be
compelled to say that we never knew
what loveliness was before. When the
clouds are swept away, when the curtains
which hide Him from our view are
drawn aside, we shall find that not anything
we have seen or heard of, grand or

a moment's comparison with Him, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"Peace</span> I leave with you." Our
Savior here means peace <i>with

He "hath reconciled us to himself by
Jesus Christ," and now there is "peace
on earth," and "good will towards men."
Christ has put our sins away, and therefore
there is a virtual substantial peace
established between God and our souls.
This, however, might exist without our
clearly understanding and rejoicing in it.
Christ has, therefore, given this further
witness&mdash;peace in the conscience. Peace
with God is the treaty: peace with conscience
is the publication of it. Peace
with God is the fountain, and peace with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
conscience is the crystal stream which
issues from it. There is a peace decreed
in the court of divine justice in heaven;
and then there follows as a necessary
consequence, as soon as the news is
known, a peace in the minor court of
human judgment, wherein conscience sits
upon the throne to judge us according to
our works. The legacy, then, of Christ
is a twofold peace; a <i>peace</i> of friendship,
of agreement, of love, of everlasting
union between the elect and God; and
a <i>peace</i> of sweet enjoyment, of quiet rest
to the understanding and the conscience.
When there are no winds above, there
will be no tempests below: when heaven
is serene, earth is quiet. Conscience reflects
the complacency of God. "Therefore
being justified by faith, we have
peace with God, through Jesus Christ
our Lord."</p>

even exalted the doubts and fears

and evidences of great advancement in
experience. But to doubt the kindness,
the faithfulness, and the love of God, is
a very heinous offence. That can be no
light sin which makes God a liar; and
yet unbelief does in effect cast foul and
slanderous suspicion upon the veracity
of the Holy One of Israel. That can
be no small offence which charges the
Creator of heaven and earth with perjury;
and yet, if I mistrust His oath, and
will not believe His promise, sealed with
the blood of His own Son, I count the
oath of God to be unworthy of my trust;
and so I do, in very deed, accuse the
King of Heaven as false to His covenant
and oath. Besides, unbelief of God is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

heaven and earth are not so separate
as unbelief has dreamed.
As the Lord hath but one family,
written in one register, redeemed with
one blood, quickened by one Spirit, so
this whole household abides in one habitation
evermore. We who are in the
body abide in the lower room, which is
sometimes dark and cold, but bears sufficient
marks that it is a room in God's
house; for to the eye of our faith, it is
often lit up with heavenly lustre, and we,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
even we, while we are yet here, are by
blessed earnests made partakers of the

the same house, I say, but ours is the
lower room, while our glorified brethren
are up there in the upper story, where
the sunlight streams in everlastingly,
where no chilling winds or poisonous
breath can ever reach. And, to a great
extent, there is a likeness between the
lower room and the upper room. As on
earth we prepare for heaven, so the state
of the saints on earth is heaven foreshadowed.
In many respects the condition
of the child of God on earth is a
type of his condition in heaven; and what
the character of the saints is above, that
should be the character of the saints below.
We may very safely take for our
example those glorified spirits. We need
not be afraid that we shall be led astray
by imitating them, by learning their occupations,
or by attempting to share their
joys. Surely the things in heaven are
patterns of the things on earth, and as

<h3 id="pg125">Obtaining Promises.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/g.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">God</span> sometimes gives His people
fresh promises "by faith,"
just before a trial is about to
come upon them. It was so with
Elijah. God said to him, "Go to the
brook Cherith; behold, I have commanded
the ravens to feed thee there."
This was at the beginning of the famine.
There he abode, and God fulfilled the
promise, for by faith Elijah had obtained
it. Acting upon faith, still dependent
upon God, he abides at Cherith, and as
the result of this faith, God gives him a
fresh promise, "Arise, get thee to Zarephath&mdash;I
have commanded a widow
woman there to sustain thee." The faith
which received the first promise, obtained
the honor of a second. So with us. If
we have had a little promise, and up till
now have realized it; if we have lived
upon it and made it the stay and support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of our souls, surely God will give us another
and a greater one. And so, from
promise to promise speeding our way,
we shall find the promises to be rounds
of the ladder which Jacob saw, the top
whereof shall reach to heaven. Doubt
and be distrustful about the promise
which you have, and you cannot expect
God to increase His revelation to your
soul. Be afraid and unbelieving about
that promise which was laid to your
heart yesterday, and you shall not have a
new one to-morrow. But act in simple
faith upon what God has already given
you, and you shall go from strength to
strength, receiving grace upon grace,
and promise upon promise. The Spirit
of God shall whisper into your soul some
promise which shall come home with as
much power as though an angel from
heaven had spoken it to you, and you
shall "through faith" obtain promises
which before were beyond your reach.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Sympathy</span> is especially a
<i>Christian's</i> duty. Consider what
the Christian is, and you will say
that if every other man were selfish,
<i>he</i> should be disinterested; if there were
nowhere else a heart which had sympathy
for the needy, there should be one
found in every Christian breast. The
Christian is a "king:" it becometh not
a king to be meanly caring for himself.
Was Alexander ever more royal than
when, while his troops were suffering
from thirst, he put aside a bowl full of
the precious liquid, which a soldier offered
him, and said it was not fitting for
a king to drink while his subjects were
thirsty; he had rather share their sorrow
with them? O ye, whom God has made
kings and princes, reign royally over
your own selfishness, and act with the
honorable liberality which becomes the
seed royal of the universe. You are sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
into the world to be saviours of others;
but how shall you be so if you care only
for yourselves? It is yours to be lights;
and doth not a light consume itself while
it scatters its rays into the thick darkness?
Is it not your office and privilege to have
it said of you, as of your Master&mdash;"He
saved others, himself he cannot save?"</p>

<h3 id="pg128">"Endure Hardness."</h3>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Soldier</span> of Christ, thou wilt
have to do hard battle. There is
no bed of down for thee; there is
no riding to heaven in a chariot:
the rough way must be trodden; mountains
must be climbed; rivers must be
forded; dragons must be fought; giants
must be slain; difficulties must be overcome;
and great trials must be borne.
It is not a smooth road to heaven; those
who have gone but a very few paces
therein, have found it to be rough and
rugged. Yet it is pleasant; it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
most delightful journey in all the world;
not because it is easy in itself, it is only
pleasant because of the company; because
of the sweet promises on which
we lean; because of our Beloved who
walks with us through all the rough
and thorny brakes of this vast wilderness.
Christian soldiers, expect conflict:
"Think it not strange concerning the
fiery trial which is to try you, as though
some strange thing happened unto you."
As truly as thou art a child of God, thy
Saviour hath left thee for His legacy&mdash;"In
the world ye shall have tribulation."
Yet remember that this "tribulation" is
the way to "<i>enter the kingdom</i>;" therefore
"endure hardness as a good soldier
of Jesus Christ."</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/c.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Christian</span> men ought so to
live that it were idle to speak of
a comparison between them and
the men of the world. It should
not be a comparison, but a contrast. No
scale of degrees should be possible: the
believer should be a direct and manifest
contradiction to the unregenerate. The
life of a saint should be altogether above
and out of the same list as the life of a
sinner. We should compel our critics
not to confess that moralists are good,
and Christians a little better; but while
the world is darkness, we should manifestly
be light; and while the world lieth
in the Wicked One, we should most evidently
be of God, and overcome the
temptations of that Wicked One. Wide
as the poles asunder, are life and death,
light and darkness, purity and sin.
There should be as much difference between
the worldling and the Christian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as between hell and heaven, between
destruction and eternal life. As we hope
at last that there shall be a great gulf
separating us from the doom of the impenitent,
there should be here a deep
and wide gulf between us and the ungodly.
The purity of our character
should be such, that men must take
knowledge of us that we are of another
and superior race. If we were what we
profess to be, there would be no difficulty
in detecting the Christian from the
worldling. But, alas! the Church is so
much adulterated, that we have to abate
our glorying, and cannot exalt our character
as we would. O, for the time when
"our conversation shall be in heaven,"
and the ignoble life of the worldly man
shall be rebuked by our Christ-like character!
God grant us more and more to
be clearly a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
people; that we may show forth the
praises of Him who has called us out of
darkness into his marvellous light.</p>

<h3 id="pg132">The Fight of Faith.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/l.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Like</span> the Spartans, every Christian
is born a warrior. It is his
destiny to be assaulted; it is his
duty to attack. Part of his life
will be occupied with defensive warfare.
He will have to defend earnestly the
faith once delivered to the saints; he will
have to resist the devil; he will have to
stand against all his wiles; and having
done all, still to stand. He will, however,
be but a sorry Christian if he acteth
only on the defensive; he must be one
who goes against his foes. He must be
able to say with David, "I come against
thee in the name of the Lord of hosts,
the God of the armies of Israel whom
thou hast defied." He must wrestle not
with flesh and blood, but against principalities
and powers. He must have
weapons for his warfare&mdash;not carnal&mdash;but
"mighty through God to the pulling
down of strongholds." He must not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
content to live in the stronghold well-guarded,
but he must go forth to attack
the castles of the enemy, and to drive the
Canaanite out of the land. But there
are many ways in which the Christian
may, to a great degree, forget his martial
character. And, alas! there are not a
few who, if they be Christians at all,
certainly know but very little of that daily
warfare to which the Captain of our
salvation calleth His disciples. They
have a soft religion; a religion which
shuns opposition; a reed-like religion,
which bows before every blast, unlike that
cedar of godliness which standeth aloft
in the midst of the storm, and claps its
boughs in the hurricane for very joy of
triumph, though the earth be all in arms
abroad. Such men lack the faith which
shares the glory. Though saved, yet
their names shall not be found written
among the mighty men who, for our
Great Commander's sake, are willing to
suffer the loss of all things, and to go
forth without the camp bearing His re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>proach.
O, let us never be contented
with such inglorious ease, but earnestly
and manfully fight the Lord's battles. Is
it a little thing for a follower of Christ to
be losing the immortal honor of serving
the Lord? What will not men do to win
fame? and shall we, when it lies at our
doors, turn idly aside and cast our glory
to the ground? Let us be up and doing,
for it is no light thing to be losing the
honor of a faithful servant of Christ.</p>

<h3 id="pg134">Life's Great Object.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> Christians, we ought ever to
be distinguished from the world
<i>in the great object of our life</i>.
As for worldly men, some of them
are seeking wealth, others of them fame;
some seek after comfort, others after
pleasure. Subordinately you may seek
after any of these, but your main and
principal motive as a Christian should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
always be to live for Christ. To live for
glory? Yes, but for His glory. To live
for comfort? Yes, but be all your consolation
in Him. To live for pleasure?
Yes, but when you are merry, sing
psalms, and make melody in your hearts
to the Lord. To live for wealth? Yes,
but to be rich in faith. You may lay
up treasure, but lay it up in heaven,
"where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves do not break
through nor steal." You can make the
most common calling become really
sacred by dedicating your daily life
wholly to the service of Jesus, taking as
your motto, "<i>For me to live is Christ</i>."
There is such a thing as living thus a
consecrated life; and if any deny its
possibility let them stand self-convicted,
because they obey not that precept:
"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
God."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Christian's sympathy should
ever be of the widest character,
because he serves a God of infinite
love. When the precious
stone of love is thrown by grace into the
crystal pool of a renewed heart, it stirs
the transparent life-floods into ever-widening
circles of sympathy: the first ring
has no very wide circumference&mdash;we love
our household; for he who careth not
for his own household is worse than a
heathen man. But mark the next concentric
ring&mdash;we love the household of
faith: "We know that we have passed
from death unto life, because we love the
brethren." Look once more, for the
ever-widening ring has reached the very
limit of the lake, and included all in its
area, for "supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks are to be
made for all men." A follower of Jesus
means a friend of man. A Christian is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a philanthropist by profession, and generous
by force of grace; wide as the
reign of sorrow is the stretch of his love,

to God's bright throne, find first thy way
to Jesus' cross; if thou wouldst know the

it. Such are the redeemed of God;
they are not fountains by nature, out of
whom there springeth up anything which
is good; they are simply receivers. At
one time they are full of themselves, but
grace empties them, and then as empty
vessels they are set in the way of God's
goodness; God fills them to the brim
with His lovingkindness, and so they are
proved to be the vessels of His mercy.
They may as "vessels" afterwards give
out to others, but they can only give out
what God has put in them; they may
work out their own salvation with fear
and trembling, but they cannot work it
out unless God worketh in them both to

They may run over with gratitude, but

comfort him; tell him that God watcheth

If that does not suffice, tell him of

much left, though much is gone; tell
him there is "now no condemnation to

<h3 id="pg150">Religion a Present Concern.</h3>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/r.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Religion</span> must be a thing of
the present, because the <i>present
has such intimate connections
with the future</i>. We are
told in Scripture that this life is a seed-time,
and the future is the harvest, "he
that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh
reap corruption; he that soweth to the
spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting."
As the seed generates the
plant, even so doth this present life generate
the eternal future. Heaven and
hell are, after all, but the developments
of our present character, for is it not
written, "he that is holy, let him be
holy still; he that is unjust, let him be
unjust still?" Do we not know that in
the heart of every sin condemnation
slumbers? Is it not a fearful truth that
the germ of everlasting torment sleeps in
every vile wish, every unholy thought,
every unclean act, so that hell is but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
great breaking out of slumbering lava,
which had been so quiet, that while the
mountain was covered with fair verdure,
even to its summit, death comes and bids
that lava rise; and down the steeps of
manhood's eternal existence, the fiery
lava of eternal misery doth pour itself?
Yet it was there before, for sin is hell,
and rebellion against God is the prelude
of misery. So is it with heaven; I know
that heaven is a reward, not of debt but
of grace; but still the Christian has that
within him which forestalls for him a
heaven. What did Christ say? "I
<i>give</i> unto my sheep eternal life." He
did not say, "<i>I will give</i>," but "<i>I do
give</i>." As soon as they believe in Me, I
give them eternal life. "He that believeth
on Him that sent Me hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into condemnation."
The Christian hath within
him the seed-beds of a paradise; in due
time the light which is sown for the
righteous, and the gladness which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sown for the upright in heart, shall spring
up, and they shall reap the harvest. Is
it not plain, then, that religion is a thing
which we must have here? Is it not
prominently revealed that religion is important
for the present? For if this life
be the seed-time of the future, how can
I expect to reap in another world other
harvests than I have been sowing here?
How can I trust that I shall be saved
then, unless I am saved now? How can
I have hope that heaven shall be my eternal
inheritance, unless the earnest be
begun in my own soul on earth?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I am persuaded that if we
looked more to Jesus, our troubles

great or so grievous. In the
darkest night of trial, looking to Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
will clear the ebon sky. When the darkness
seems thick, like that of Egypt,
"darkness that might be felt," even then,
like a bright lightning flash, as vivid, but
not so transient, will a look to Jesus
prove. One glimpse of Him may well
suffice for all our toils while on the road.
Looking to Him will illuminate the most
dreary way. Cheered by His voice,
nerved by His strength, we are prepared
to do and to suffer, even as he did,
unto the end. O, weary and troubled
Christians, "look unto Him, and be
lightened!"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> gospel is not a scheme of
giving <i>to</i> God, but of receiving

fulness, drinking out of His
"wells of salvation," receiving from His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
storehouse. Sinner! remember all that
God asks of thee, in order to thy salvation,
is, that thou wouldst be a <i>receiver</i>,
and this He gives thee, even the power
to receive. He asks thee not to do anything,
but to hold out thine empty hand,
and take all thou wantest. He does not
bid thee store thy granaries and become
rich, but he bids thee simply confess thy
poverty, and open the doors of thine
empty chambers, that He may pour thee
out a blessing such as thou shalt scarcely
find room to contain. Hast thou learnt
this truth? Hast thou come to live as a
receiver at the hand of God? Hast thou
stood at Mercy's gate, humbly seeking
salvation? For, if thou hast not&mdash;if
thou hast never yet been willing to take
the riches of grace from God instead of
giving to Him of thine own worthless
doings&mdash;if thou art not willing to be a
recipient of His gratuitous goodness,
thou art a total stranger to everything
like the gospel of Christ.</p>

He will be Lord paramount, Master

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is an expression used
by the apostle Paul respecting
the Lord Jesus, which is very
beautiful and significant&mdash;"who
<i>knew</i> no sin." It does not merely say
<i>did</i> none, but <i>knew</i> none. Sin was no
acquaintance of His; He was acquainted
with grief, but no acquaintance of sin.
He had to walk in the midst of its most
frequented haunts, but did not know it.
Not that He was ignorant of its nature,
or unaware of its penalty, but He did not
<i>know</i> it; He was a stranger to it; He
never by word, by nod, or by smile, gave
it the faintest recognition. Of course He
knew what sin was, for He was very
God, but with sin He had no communion,
no fellowship, no brotherhood.
He was a perfect stranger in the presence
of sin; He was a foreigner; He
was not an inhabitant of that land
where sin is acknowledged. He passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
through the wilderness of suffering, but
into the wilderness of sin He could never
go. "He <i>knew</i> no sin:" mark that expression
and treasure it up; and when
you are thinking of your Substitute, and
behold Him bleeding upon the cross,
think that you see written in those lines
of blood, "He knew no sin." Mingled

Rose of Sharon&mdash;behold the purity of
His nature&mdash;the Lily of the Valley&mdash;"He
knew no sin."</p>

His heart is made of tenderness, His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

He is afflicted. Since the day
when He became flesh of our flesh, He
hath never hidden Himself from our sufferings.
Our glorious Head is moved
with all the sorrows which distress the
members. Crowned though He now is,
He forgets not the thorns which once He
wore; amid the splendors of His regal
state in Paradise, He is not unmindful
of His children here below. Still is He
persecuted when Saul persecutes the
saints; still are His brethren as the apple
of His eye, and very near His heart. If
ye can find in Christ a grain of selfishness,
consecrate yourselves unto your
lusts, and let Mammon be your God.
If ye can find in Christ a solitary atom
of hardness of heart and callousness of

hearts are as stone to the wailing of the

of the Man of Nazareth, be ye
full of compassion; He feedeth the hungry

help. If ye are His disciples, go and
do likewise.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are still people to be
found foolish enough to believe
that events occur at hap-hazard,
without divine predestination,
and different calamities transpire without
the overruling hand, or the direct agency
of God. Alas! for us, if chance had
aught to do with events of our life. We
should be like poor mariners, put out to
sea in an unsafe vessel, without a chart
and without a helm; we should know
nothing of the port to which we might
ultimately come; we should only feel
that we were now the sport of the winds,
the captives of the tempest, and might
soon be the victims of the all-devouring

deep. Alas! poor orphans were we all,
if we were indebted for food and clothing,
for present comfort and future prospects,
to nothing but chance. No father's
care to watch over us, but left to the
fickleness and fallibility of mortal things!
What were all that we see about us, but
a great sand-storm in the midst of a
desert, blinding our eyes, preventing us
from ever hoping to see the end through
the darkness of the beginning? We
should be pilgrims in a pathless waste,
where there were no roads to direct us&mdash;travellers
who might be overturned
and overwhelmed at any moment, and
our bleached bones left the victims of the
tempest, unknown, or forgotten of all.
Thank God, it is not so with us. We
believe that everything which happens
to us is ordered by the wise and tender
will of Him who is our Father and our
Friend; we see order in the midst of
confusion; we see purposes accomplished
where others discern nothing but void
and vacancy. We believe that "He hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Art</span> thou proud, believer, because
thou hast been profitable
to the Church, and done some
little service to thy times? Who
maketh thee to differ, and what hast thou
which thou hast not received? Hast
thou shed a little light upon the darkness?
Ah! who lit thy candle&mdash;and
who is it who keeps thee still shining,
and prevents thee from being extinguished?
Hast thou overcome temptation?
Hang not up thy banner; do not
decorate thine own bosom with the
glory; for who made thee strong in the
battle? Who made thy sword sharp,
and nerved thine arm to strike the foe?
Remember, thou hast done nothing
whatever of thyself. If thou be this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
day a vessel unto honor, decorated and
gilded&mdash;if now thou art a precious vase,
filled with the sweetest perfume, yet
thou didst not make thyself so. Thou
art the clay, but <i>who</i> is the potter? If
thou be a vessel unto honor, yet not a
vessel unto thine own honor, but a vessel
unto the honor of Him who made thee.
If thou standest among thy fellow-men
as the angels stand above the fallen
spirits&mdash;a chosen one, distinguished
from them&mdash;yet remember, it was not
any goodness in thyself which made thee
to be chosen; nor has it been any of
thine own efforts, or thine own power,
which lifted thee out of the miry clay,
set thy feet on the rock, and established
thy goings. Off with the crown from
thy proud head, and lay down thine
honors at the feet of Him who gave them
to thee. With cherubim and seraphim
veil thy face, and cry, "Not unto us, not
unto us, but unto His name be all the
glory forever and ever."</p>

<p>And when thou art thus bowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
down with humility, be thou prepared
to learn this other lesson&mdash;<i>never depend
on thyself again</i>. If thou hast
aught to do, go not forth to do it leaning
on an arm of flesh. First bow thy knee,
and ask power of Him who makes thee
strong, and then thou shalt come back
from thy labor rejoicing. But if thou
goest in thine own strength, thou shalt
break thy ploughshare on the rock; thou
shalt sow thy seed by the side of the salt
sea upon the barren sand, and thou shalt
look upon the naked acres in years to
come, and they shall not yield thee so
much as a single blade to make glad
thine heart. "Trust ye in the Lord forever:
for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
strength." That strength is not
available to you so long as you repose in
any strength of your own. He will help
you if you confess your weakness; but
if you are strong in yourself, He will
take way his own power from you, and
you will stumble and fall. Learn, then,
the grace of depending daily upon God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

humility.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">You</span> will never perceive God in
nature, until you have learned to
see God in grace. We have
heard a great deal about going
up from nature to nature's God. Impossible!
A man might as well attempt to
go from the top of the Alps to heaven.
There is still a great gulf between nature
and God to the natural mind. You must
first of all perceive God incarnate in the
person of Christ, before you will perceive
God omnipotent in the creation which He
has made. You have heard a great deal
about men delighting to worship in the
forest glades, who disdain to frequent
the sanctuary of the saints. Ay; but
there was little truth in it. There is
often great sound where there is much
emptiness; and you will frequently find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that those men who talk most of this
natural worship, are those who do not
worship God at all. God's works are
too gross a medium to allow the light.
Rugged is the path and dark the atmosphere,
if we go by way of the creatures
to find out the Creator to perfection.
But when I see Christ, I see God's new

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">God's</span> people are often chastened,
and the Lord's hand lieth
heavy upon them; yet there is
paternal goodness in their chastenings,
and infinite lovingkindness in
their tribulations. Did you ever hear
this parable? There was a certain shepherd
who had a sheep which he desired
to lead into another and better field; he
called it, and it would not come; he led
it, and it would not follow; he drove it,
but it would only follow its own devices.
At last he thought within himself, "I
will do this." The sheep had a little
lamb by its side, and the shepherd took
the lamb up in his arms, and carried it
away, and then the ewe came too. And
so with you; God has been calling to <i>you</i>,
and you did not come; Christ said,
"Come," and you would not; He sent
affliction, and you would not come; at
length He took your child away, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
came forthwith; you followed the Saviour
then. You see it was loving work
on the shepherd's part. He did but take
the lamb to save the sheep, and the
Saviour but took your child to heaven
that He might bring <i>you</i> there also.
Oh, blessed afflictions, blessed losses,
blessed deaths, which end in spiritual
life! You know that if a man desires
to gather a harvest from his field, he first
ploughs it up. The field might complain,
and say, "Why these scars across
my face? Why this rough upturning?"
Because there can be no sowing till there
has been ploughing; sharp ploughshares
make furrows for good seed. Or take
yet another picture from nature: a man
desireth to make of a rusty piece of iron,
a bright sword which shall be serviceable
to a great warrior. What doth he
do? He putteth it into the fire, and
melteth it; he taketh away all its dross,
and removeth all its tin; then he fashioneth
it with his hammer; he beateth it
full sore upon the anvil; he anneals it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one fire after another, till at last it comes
out a good blade which will not snap in
the day of warfare. This is what God
doeth with you&mdash;I pray you do not misread
the book of God's providence; for
if you read it aright it runs thus&mdash;"I
will have mercy on this man, and therefore
have I smitten him and wounded
him. As many as I love I rebuke and
chasten." Come, therefore, let us return
unto the Lord, for He hath wounded and
He will heal; He hath smitten and He
will bind us up.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"For</span> the joy that was set before
Him He endured the cross."
What was the joy? Oh, 'tis a
thought must melt a rock, and
make a heart of iron move, that the joy
which was set before Jesus, was principally
the joy of saving us. I know it
was the joy of fulfilling His Father's will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&mdash;of
sitting down on His Father's throne&mdash;of
being made perfect through suffering;
but still I know that this is the
grand, great motive of the Saviour enduring
the cross&mdash;the joy of saving us.
Do you know what the joy is of doing
good to others? If you do not, I pity
you, for of all joys which God has left
in this poor wilderness, this is one of
the sweetest. Do you know it? Have
you never felt that joy divine, when your
gold has been given to the poor, and
your silver has been dedicated to the
Lord, when you bestowed it upon the
hungry&mdash;and you have gone aside, and
said, "I feel it is a joy worth living for
to feed the hungry, and clothe the naked,
and to do good to my poor suffering
fellow-creatures?" Now, this is the joy
which Christ felt; it was the joy of feeding
us with the bread of heaven; the joy
of clothing poor, naked sinners in His
own righteousness; the joy of finding a
home for homeless souls, of delivering
us from the prison of hell, and giving us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the eternal enjoyments of heaven. See
the greatness of His love which thus led
Him to endure the cross and despise the
shame, that He might save sinners.
Truly Christ's love "passeth knowledge!"
Christians! if Christ endured
all this for the joy of saving you, will
<i>you</i> be ashamed of bearing or suffering
anything for Christ? Surely love to Him
who hath so loved us should make us
willing to endure all things for His sake.
Do you feel that in following Christ you
must lose by it&mdash;lose honor, position,
wealth? Do you feel that in being a
Christian you incur ridicule and reproach?
and will you turn aside because
of these little things, when He would
not turn aside, but endured the cross and
despised the shame? No, by the grace
of God let every Christian say,&mdash;</p>

well as when the vat was bursting and
overflowing its brim. If you had more
confidence in God, you would have far
less of tossings up and down; and if you
had greater nearness to Christ, you
would have less vacillation. At times
you can bid defiance to the rage of Satan,
boldly meet every attack, and resist every
temptation; but too often you are fearful
and irresolute, and ready to run away
from the fight instead of making valiant
resistance. But if you always remember
Him who endured such contradiction of
sinners against Himself, you might always
be firm and steadfast. Live near
your Master, and you shall not be thus
changeful and uncertain. Beware of
being like a weathercock. Seek of God,
that His law may be written on your
heart as if it were written in stone, and
not as if it were written in sand. Seek
that His grace may come to you like a
river, and not like a brook which fails.
Seek that you may keep your conversation
always holy; that your course may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
be like the shining light which tarries
not, but burns brighter and brighter
until the fulness of the day. Seek that
the "God of all grace may establish,
strengthen, settle you."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">While</span> we most earnestly seek
after the full assurance of faith,
knowing it is our strength and
our joy, let us at the same time
remember that there is a <i>temptation</i> connected
with it. When thou hast gained
this full assurance, believer, then be on
thy watch-tower, for the next temptation
will be, "Soul, take thine ease; the work
is done; thou <i>hast</i> attained; now fold
thine arms; sit thou still; all will end
well; why needest thou too much to vex
thyself?" Take heed in those seasons
when you have no doubts. "Watch and
pray, that ye enter not into temptation."
"Let him that thinketh he stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>eth
take heed lest he fall." "I said, I
shall never be moved. Lord, by Thy
favor Thou hast made my mountain to
stand strong." And what next? "Thou
didst hide Thy face, and I was troubled."
Bless God for full assurance;
but, remember, nothing but careful walking
can preserve it. Full assurance is
a priceless pearl; but when a man has
a precious jewel, and he walks the streets,
he ought to be much afraid of pickpockets.
So, when the Christian has
full assurance, let him be sure that Satan
will try to rob him of it. Let him be
more circumspect in his walk, and more
diligent in his watch than he was before.</p>

Only a few; not so few as some think,
but not so many as others imagine. A
few compared with the mass of professors:
a few compared even with the
true children of God, for many of <i>them</i>
have defiled their garments. There were
but a few, and those few were even in
<i>Sardis</i>. There is not a Church on
earth which is so corrupt but has "a

<p>Take heart, Christians; there are a

down. <i>Some</i> heroes have not turned
their backs in the day of battle; <i>some</i>
mighty men still fight for the truth. But
be careful, for, perhaps, you are not one
of the "few." Since there are but "a
few," there ought to be great searchings
of heart. Let us look to <i>our</i> garments,
and see whether they be defiled. And
since there are but "few," <i>be active</i>.
The fewer the workmen to do the work,
the greater reason is there that you
should be active. "Be instant in season,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
out of season." Oh! if we had hundreds
behind us, we might say, "Let
<i>them</i> do the work;" but if we stand
with only "a few," how should each of
those few exert themselves!</p>

<p>Stir yourselves up, then, to the greatest
activity, for verily there are but a
few in Sardis who have not defiled their
garments. Above all, <i>be prayerful</i>.
Put up your earnest cries to God that He
would multiply the faithful, that He
would increase the number of chosen
ones who stand fast, and that He would
purify the Church. Cry unto God that
the day may come when the much fine
gold shall be no longer dim; when the
glory shall again return to Zion. Beg
of God to remove the cloud, to take
away "the darkness that may be felt."
Be doubly prayerful, for there are but
few in Sardis who have not defiled their

the sheep had lost; not only the prodigal

Everything was brought out of Egypt;
not even Joseph's bones were left behind.
The Egyptians could not say that they

when Christ shall have conquered all

have lost one atom by the toils of Egypt,
but shall be able to say, "O <i>death</i>, where

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> we realize that all our
daily mercies come to us as the
gifts of our Father in heaven, it
makes them doubly precious to
us. There is nothing which tastes as

comes from home. So with the Christian.
All his mercies are sweeter be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>cause
they are home-mercies&mdash;they come
"from above;" the land in which he

This thought, also, has a tendency to
keep us from an overweening love of the
world. The spies went to Eshcol, and
fetched thence an immense cluster of the
grapes which grew there; but you do
not find that the people said, "The fruits
we have received from the land of promise,
make us contented to stay in the wilderness."
No; they saw that the grapes
came from Canaan, and thereupon they
said, "Let us go on and possess the
land." And so, when we get rich
mercies, if we think they come from the
natural soil of this earth alone, we might
well feel a wish to stay here. But if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> has never been a period
in this world's history when it
was wholly given up to sin.
God has always had His servants
on earth; at times they may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
been hidden by fifties in the caves, but
they have never been utterly cut off.
Grace may be low; the stream might be
very shallow, but it has never been
wholly dry. The clouds have never
been so universal as to hide the day.
But the time is fast approaching when
grace shall extend all over our world,
and "the earth shall be full of the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the
sea." "Grace doth <i>much more</i> abound;"
and whatever possessions the world has
lost by sin, it has gained <i>far more</i>
by grace. It is true we have been expelled
from a garden of delights, where
peace, love, and happiness found a glorious
habitation, but we have through
Jesus a fairer inheritance. The plains
of heaven exceed the fields of paradise in
the ever-new delights which they afford,
while the tree of life, and the river from
the throne, render the inhabitants of the
celestial regions more than imparadised.
It is true that we have become subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
death by sin, yet has not grace revealed
an immortality for the sake of which we
are glad to die? Life lost in Adam is
more than restored in Christ. Our original
robes were rent asunder by Adam,
but Jesus has clothed us with a divine
righteousness, far exceeding in value even
the spotless robes of created innocence.
We mourn our low and miserable condition
through sin, but we rejoice at the
thought, that we are now more secure
than before we fell, we are brought into
closer alliance with Jesus than our creature
standing could ever boast. O Jesus!
Thou hast won us an inheritance more
wide than Adam ever lost; Thou hast
filled our coffer with greater riches than
our sin has ever lavished; Thou hast
loaded us with honors, and endowed us
with privileges far more excellent than
our natural birthright could have procured
us. Truly, truly, "grace doth
much more abound."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> we look at our prayers,
we have much reason to deplore
the <i>unsubmissive spirit</i> which
too often pervades them. How
often have we in our prayers not simply
wrestled with God for a blessing&mdash;for
that was allowable&mdash;but we have imperiously
demanded it! We have not said,
"Deny this to me, O my God, if so thou
pleasest;" we have not been ready to
say, as the Redeemer did, "Nevertheless,
not as I will, but as Thou wilt;"
but we have asked after the blind inclination
of our ignorance, as if we could
brook no denial from the omniscient
counsel of His will. Forgetful of a
humble deference to our Lord's superior
wisdom and grace, we have asked and
declared that we would not be content
unless we had that particular desire
upon which our hearts were set. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whenever we come to God, and ask for
anything which we consider a real good,
we have a right to plead earnestly; but
we err when we go beyond the bounds
of earnestness, and come to <i>demand</i>. It
is ours to ask for a blessing, but not to
define what the blessing shall be. It is
ours to place our head beneath the
mighty hands of divine benediction, but
it is not ours to uplift the hands, as Joseph
did those of Jacob, and say, "Not so,
my father." We must be content if He
gives the blessing cross-handed; quite
as content that He should put His
left hand on our head as the right.
We must not intrude into God's almonry,
"It is the Lord, let Him do as
seemeth Him good." Prayer was never
meant to be a fetter upon the sovereignty
of God. We must always subjoin at
the bottom of the prayer this heavenly
postscript, "Father, deny this if it be
most for Thy glory." Christ will have
nothing to do with dictatorial prayers.</p>

but he would be happier still if he had
religion. The man who has a fulness
of earthly pleasure, would not lose any
part of his happiness, had he the grace
of God in his heart; rather that joy
would add sweetness to all his prosperity;
it would strain off many of the
bitter dregs from his cup, and show him
how to extract more honey from the
honeycomb. Godliness can make the
most melancholy joyful, while it can
make the joyous ones more joyful still,
lighting up the face with a heavenly

precious because they are given to him,
as it were, in some codicils of the divine
testament, which hath promise of the life
which now is, as well as of that which

follow him all the days of his life, he

crime and iniquity. He is the gentle
lover of our souls; the good Shepherd
coming forth, not so much to slay the

you. I know thy fears; I know
thou sayest in thy heart, "He will reject
me. If I present my prayer, He will
not hear me; if I cry unto Him, yet per-adventure,
the heavens will be as brass;
I have been so great a sinner, that He
will never take me into His house to
dwell with Him." Poor sinner! say not
so; <i>He</i> hath published the decree. Is
not this enough? He has said, "Him
that cometh to me I will in no wise cast
out." Dost thou not venture on that
promise? Wilt thou not go to sea in a
ship as stanch as this. <i>He hath said</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<i>it</i>? It has been often the only comfort
of the saints; on this they have lived,
on this they have died. <i>He hath
said it.</i> What! dost thou think Christ
would tell thee He will receive thee, and
yet not do so? Would He say, "Come
ye to the supper," and yet shut the door
upon you? No; if He has said He will
cast out none that come to Him, rest
assured He cannot, He will not cast you
out. Come, then, try His love on this
ground, that He has said it. Come, and
fear not, because remember, if thou feelest
thyself to be a sinner, that feeling is
God's gift; and therefore thou mayst very
safely come to One who has already done
so much to draw thee. If thou feelest thy
need of a Saviour, Christ made thee feel
it; if thou hast a wish to come after
Christ, Christ gave thee that wish; if
thou hast any desire after God, God gave
thee that desire; if thou canst sigh after
Christ, Christ made thee sigh; if thou
canst weep after Christ, Christ made
thee weep. Ay, if thou canst only wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
for Him with the strong wish of one who
fears he never can find, yet hopes he
may&mdash;if thou canst but hope for Him,
He has given thee that hope. And O,
wilt not thou come to Him? Thou hast
some of the King's bounties about thee
now; come and plead what He hath
done; there is no suit which can ever fail
with God, when thou pleadest this.
Come to Him, and thou wilt find it is
true which is written, that "this man
receiveth sinners."</p>

<h3 id="pg202">"Wherein Ye Greatly Rejoice."</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"Wherein</span> ye greatly rejoice,
though now for a season, if need
be, ye are in heaviness." And
can a Christian "greatly rejoice"
while he is "in heaviness?" Yes, most
assuredly he can. Mariners tell us that
there are some parts of the sea where
there is a strong current upon the surface
going one way, while, down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
depths there is a strong current running
the other way. Two seas also do not
meet and interfere with one another, but
one stream of water on the surface is
running in one direction, and another
below in an opposite direction. Now,
the Christian is like that. On the surface
there is a stream of heaviness
rolling in dark waves, but down in the
depths there is a strong under-current of
great rejoicing which is always flowing
there. Do you ask what is the cause of
this great rejoicing? The apostle tells us,
"<i>Wherein</i> ye greatly rejoice." What
does he mean? Refer to his epistle, and
you will see. He is writing "to the strangers
scattered throughout Pontus, etc."
And the first thing which He says to
them is, that they are "elect according
to the foreknowledge of God." This is
an assurance "wherein ye greatly rejoice."
Ah! even when the Christian
is most "in heaviness through manifold
temptations," what a mercy it is that he
can know that he is still elect of God!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Any man who is assured that God "has
chosen him from before the foundation
of the world," may well say, "Wherein
I greatly rejoice." Let us reflect on this.
Before God made the heavens and the
earth, or laid the pillars of the firmament
in their golden sockets, He set His love
upon me; upon the breast of the great
High Priest He wrote my name; and in
His everlasting book it stands, never to
be erased&mdash;"elect according to the foreknowledge
of God." Why, this may make
a man's soul leap within him, and all
the heaviness which the infirmities of the
flesh may lay upon him shall be but as
nothing; for this tremendous current of
His overflowing joy shall sweep away
the mill-dam of his grief. Bursting
and overleaping every obstacle, it shall
overflood all his sorrows till they are
drowned and covered up, and shall not
be mentioned any more forever. "Wherein
ye greatly rejoice." Come, Christian!
thou art depressed and cast down. Think
for a moment: thou art chosen of God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and precious. Let the bell of election
ring in thine ear&mdash;that ancient Sabbath-bell
of the covenant; and let thy name
be heard in its notes, and say, I beseech
thee, say, doth not this make thee
"greatly rejoice, though now for a season,
if need be, thou art in heaviness
through manifold temptations?"</p>

<p>Again, you will see another reason.
The apostle says that we are "elect
through sanctification of the Spirit, unto
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
Jesus Christ"&mdash;"wherein we greatly
rejoice." Is the obedience of the Lord
Jesus Christ girt about my loins, to be
my beauty and my glorious dress? and
is the blood of Jesus sprinkled upon me,
to take away all my guilt and all my sin?
and shall I not in this greatly rejoice?
What shall there be in all the depressions
of spirit which can possibly come
upon me which shall make me break my
harp, even though I should for a moment
hang it upon the willows? Do I
not expect that yet again my songs shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
mount to heaven; and even now, through
the thick darkness, do not the sparks of
my joy appear, when I remember that I
have still upon me the blood of Jesus, and
still about me the glorious righteousness
of the Messiah?</p>

<p>But the great and cheering comfort of
the apostle is, that we are elect unto "an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in
heaven for us," even as we are reserved
for it. Well may this indeed make him
greatly rejoice. He is drawing near the
gates of death, and his spirit is in heaviness,
for he has to leave behind him all
that life holds dear. Besides, sickness
brings upon him naturally a depression
of spirits. But you sit by him in his
chamber, and you begin to talk to him
of the</p>

<h3 id="pg207">Changefulness.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/h.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">How</span> varied is the experience
of the believer in his spiritual
life! What changes there are
in the weather of his soul!
What bright sunlight days! What dark,
cloudy nights! What calms, as though
his life were a sea of glass! What ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>rible
trials, as though his life were a
tempestuous ocean! One time we find
him crying, "My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me," and anon he
sings, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and
all that is within me bless His holy
name." One hour we hear him sigh
forth, "I sink in deep mire where there
is no standing," and then we find him
exulting, "The Lord is my light, and
my salvation, whom shall I fear: the
Lord is the strength of my life, of whom
shall I be afraid." How wondrously he
rises to heaven, and how awfully he
dives into the deeps! Surely we who
have known anything of the spiritual
and inner life do not marvel at this, for
we have felt these changes. Alas! what
a contrast between the sin which doth so
easily beset us, and the grace which gives
us to reign in heavenly places. How
different the sorrow of an abject distrust
which breaketh us in pieces as with a
strong east wind, and the joy of a holy
confidence which bears us on to heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
as a propitious gale! What changes
between walking with God to-day, and
falling into the mire to-morrow, triumphing
over sin, death, and hell yesterday,
and to-day led captive by the lusts of the
flesh and of the mind. Verily, we cannot
understand ourselves, and a description
which would suit us at one time,
would be ill-adapted at another time.
Changeable, indeed, is our experience;
but oh, what a mercy that <i>Christ</i> does
not change! Varied as our experience
may be, His grace is varied to meet it,
for He has grace to help us in every time
of need, and with infinite and unfailing
good-will supplies us in the strength proportioned
to our day.</p>

<h3 id="pg209">Thoughts of Christ.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/j.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Jesus!</span> what infinite sweets in
His name! Our impressions on
surveying Him may be compared
to some of those lenses you have
seen, which you may take up and hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
one way, and you see one light, and another
way, and you see another light,
and whichever way you turn them you
will always see some precious sparkling
of light, and some new colors starting
up to your view. Ah! take Jesus for
your theme; consider Him; think of His
relation to your own soul, and you will
never get through that one subject.
Think of His eternal relationship to you;
and also of your known and manifest
relationship to Him since you have been
called by His grace. Think how He
has become your brother; how His heart
has beaten in sympathy with yours; how
He has kissed you with the kisses of His
love, and His love has been sweeter to
you than wine. Look back upon some
happy, sunny spots in your history,
where Jesus has whispered, "I am
yours," and you have said "My beloved
is mine." Think of some choice moments,
when an angel has stooped from
heaven, and taken you up on his wings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and carried you aloft, to sit in heavenly
places where Jesus sits, that you might
commune with Him. Or think of some
moments, when you have had what Paul
sets so much store by&mdash;fellowship with
Christ in His sufferings&mdash;when you have
felt that you could die <i>for</i> Christ, even as
you have in the rich experience of your
baptism, died <i>with</i> Him, and risen <i>with</i>
Him. Think of your relationship to
Christ which is to be developed in heaven.
Imagine the hour to have come when
you shall "greet the blood-besprinkled
hand on the eternal shore," and when the
Lord Jesus shall salute you as "more
than a conqueror," and put a crown upon
your head more glittering than the stars.
Oh! take <i>Jesus</i> for your constant theme,
and you will every day find fresh thoughts
arise out of His grace, His beauty, His
glory. In Him you have an unfailing
subject of delight, object of attraction,
and centre of love.</p>

<h3 id="pg212">A Lesson of Humility.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Jesus sent forth His
seventy disciples, endowed with
miraculous powers, they performed
great wonders, and naturally
enough were somewhat elated. In
their words, "Behold, even devils were
subject to us," Jesus marked their tendency
to pride and self-congratulation.
And what was the sacred lesson He
taught to prevent their being exalted
above measure? "Nevertheless," said
He, "rejoice not in this, but rather rejoice
because your names are written in
heaven." The assurance of our interest
in Christ will tend to keep us humble in
the day of our prosperity; it will act as
a secret ballast to us to know that we
have something better than these earthly
blessings, therefore we must not set our
affections upon the things of earth, but
let our hearts be where our greatest
treasure is. Better than any lancet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
spill the superfluous blood of our boasting&mdash;better
than any bitter medicine to
chase the burning fever of our pride, is
this most precious and hallowed wine of
the covenant&mdash;a remembrance of our
safety in Christ. This, opened up to us
by the Spirit, will suffice to keep us in that
happy lowliness which is our true position.
But when at any time we are cast
down with multiplied troubles, the very
same fact which kept us humble in prosperity
will preserve us from despair in
adversity. For the apostle Paul was
surrounded by a great fight of affliction;
and yet he could say, "Nevertheless I
am not ashamed." But what is it which
preserves him from sinking? It is the
same truth which kept the ancient disciples
from overweening pride. It is the
sweet persuasion of his interest in Christ.
"For I know whom I have believed, and
am persuaded that he is able to keep that
which I have committed unto him against
that day." Then let us seek earnestly to
obtain this full assurance of faith, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
will help us in all states of experience.
Let us not rest content till we can say
with Paul, "I know whom I have
believed."</p>

<h3 id="pg214">Promises and Precepts.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap6"><span class="upper-case">If</span> thou wouldst have the promises
fulfilled to thee, look to it
that thou dost comply with <i>the
precept annexed to the promise</i>.
Follow the example of Moses. Moses
knew that there was a promise given to
the people of Israel, that they should be
the world's blessing; but in order to obtain
it, it was necessary that he should
practise self-denial, therefore he "refused
to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
choosing rather to suffer affliction
with the people of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a season." If the
promise commands thee to deny thyself,
thou canst not obtain it without. Do it,
and thou shalt have its fulfilment. Or
suppose that the promise requires courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&mdash;<i>use
courage</i>. Or does the promise require
obedience&mdash;<i>be obedient</i>. Remember
how Rahab hung out from her
window the scarlet line, because that
was the test of her faith. So do thou.
Whatsoever Christ hath said unto thee,
do it. Neglect no command, however
trivial it may seem. Do what thy Master
tells thee, asking no questions, for he
is an ill servant who questions his Lord's
command. Doubtless thou too, like the
Ethiopian eunuch, shalt go on thy way
rejoicing when thou hast been obedient.
Or is the promise made to those who
bear "a good report" of the land? Remember,
Caleb and Joshua were the only
two who obtained the promise, because
they alone honored God. So do thou
honor God. Let a scoffing world hear
thine unvarying testimony that thy God
is good and true. Let not thy groanings
and thy murmurings make men suspect
that thou hast a hard master, and that
His servants have no joys, no comforts,
no delights. Let it be known that He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
whom thou servest is no Egyptian task-master;
His yoke is easy; His service
pleasure, His reward unspeakable.
"Them that honor Me, I will honor."
Be thou careful to obey the precepts, and
God will fulfil to thee the promises.</p>

<h3 id="pg216">Sweetness in Sorrow.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/d.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Do</span> you not feel, in looking back
upon seasons of affliction, that
they have been times when, notwithstanding
the trials, you have
had unusual peace and happiness in your
heart? There is a sweet joy which
comes to us through sorrow. The bitter
wine of sorrow acts with a tonic influence
upon the whole system. The sweet
cup of prosperity often leaves a bitterness
in the taste; but the bitter cup of
affliction, when sanctified, always leaves
a sweet flavor in the mouth. There is
joy in sorrow. There is music in this
harp with its strings all unstrung and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
broken. There are a few notes we hear
from this mournful lute which we never
get from the loud-sounding trumpet.
We obtain a softness and melody from
the wail of sorrow, which we never get
from the song of joy. Must we not
account for this by the fact, that in our
troubles we live nearer to God? Our
joy is like the wave as it dashes upon
the shore&mdash;it throws us on the earth.
But our sorrows are like that receding
wave which sucks us back again into the
great depth of Godhead. We should
have been stranded and left high and
dry upon the shore, if it had not been
for that receding wave, that ebbing of
our prosperity, which carried us back
to our Father and to our God again.
Blessed affliction! it has brought us to
the mercy-seat; given life to prayer; enkindled
love; strengthened faith; brought
Christ into the furnace with us, and then
brought us out of the furnace to live with
Christ more joyously than before.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="pg218">Little-faith.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/o.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> inconvenience of "little-faith"
is, that <i>while it is always
sure of heaven, it very seldom
thinks so</i>. Little-faith is quite as
secure for heaven as Great-faith. When
Jesus Christ counts up His jewels at the
last day, He will take to Himself the
little pearls as well as the great ones.
If a diamond be never so small, yet it is
precious because it is a diamond. So
faith, be it never so little, if it be true
faith, is "like precious" with that which
apostles obtained. Christ will never
lose even the smallest jewel of His
crown. Little-faith is always secure of
heaven, because the name of Little-faith
is in the book of eternal life. Little-faith
was chosen of God before the
foundation of the world. Little-faith
was bought with the blood of Christ;
ay, and he cost as much as Great-faith.
"For every man a shekel," was the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of redemption. Every man, whether
great or small, prince or peasant, had to
redeem himself with a shekel. Christ
has bought all, both little and great, with
the same most precious blood. Little-faith
is always secure of heaven, for God
has begun the work in him, and He
will carry it on. God loves him, and
He will love him unto the end. God
has provided a crown for him, and He
will not allow the crown to hang there
useless; He has erected for him a mansion
in heaven, and He will not allow
the mansion to stand untenanted forever.
Little-faith is always safe, but he very seldom
knows it. If you meet him he is
sometimes afraid of hell; very often afraid
that the wrath of God abideth on him.
He will tell you that the country on the
other side the flood can never belong to
one so base as he. Sometimes it is because
he feels himself so unworthy; another
time it is because the things of God
are too good to be true, he says; or he cannot
think they can be true to such a one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
as he. Sometimes he is afraid he is not
elect; another time he fears that he has
not been called aright, or that he has not
come to Christ aright; anon, his fears
are that he will not hold on to the end,
that he shall not be able to persevere;
and if you kill a thousand of his fears,
he is sure to have another host by to-morrow;
for unbelief is one of those
things which you cannot destroy; you
may kill it over and over again, but still
it lives. It is one of those ill weeds
which sleep in the soil even after it has
been burned, and it only needs a little
encouragement, or a little negligence,
and it will sprout up again. Now,
Great-faith is sure of heaven, and he
knows it. He climbs Pisgah's top, and
views the landscape o'er; he tastes of the
sweetness of paradise even before he
enters within the pearly gates; he sees
the streets which are paved with gold;
he beholds the walls of the city, the
foundations whereof are of precious
stones; he hears the mystic music of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
glorified, and begins to smell on earth
the perfumes of heaven. But poor Little-faith
can scarcely look at the sun; he
very seldom sees the light; he gropes in
the valley, and while all is safe, he
always thinks himself unsafe.</p>

<h3 id="pg221">"To be with Christ."</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.png" width="65" height="81" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i><span class="upper-case">"To</span> be with Christ</i>." Who can
comprehend this but the Christian?
It is a heaven which
worldlings care not for. They
know not what a mass of glory is
crowded into that one sentence: "To
be with Christ." But to the believer the
words are a concentration of bliss.
Take only one of the many precious
thoughts the words suggest&mdash;<i>the sight
of Christ</i>. "Thine eye shall see the
King in His beauty." We have heard
of Him, and can say, "Whom having
not seen we love." But then we "<i>shall
see Him</i>." Yes, we shall actually gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
upon the exalted Redeemer. Realize
the thought. Is there not a heaven
within it? Thou shalt see the hands
which were nailed to the cross for thee;
thou shalt see the thorn-crowned head,
and with all the blood-washed throng,
shalt thou bow with lowly reverence
before Him, who bowed in lowly abasement
for thee. Faith is precious, but what
must sight be? To view Jesus as the
Lamb of God through the glass of faith,
makes the soul rejoice with joy unspeakable;
but oh! to see Him face to face,
to look into those eyes, to hear that voice&mdash;rapture
begins at the very mention of
it! If even to <i>think</i> of it is so sweet,
what must the <i>vision</i> be when we shall
talk with Him, "even as a man talketh
with his friend"&mdash;for the vision of
Christ implies <i>communion</i>. All that
which the spouse desired in Solomon's
Song, we shall have, and ten thousand
times more. Then will the prayer be
fulfilled, "Let Him kiss me with the
kisses of His mouth: for Thy love is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
better than wine." Then we shall be
able to say, "His left hand is under my
head, and His right hand doth embrace
me." Then shall we experience the
promise, "They shall walk with me in
white, for they are worthy." And then
we will pour out the song of gratitude,
a song such as we have never sung on
earth, tuneful, dulcet, pure, full of serenity
and joy, no discord to mar its melody;
a song rapt and seraphic. Happy day,
when vision and communion shall be
ours in fulness&mdash;when we shall know
even as we are known!</p>
